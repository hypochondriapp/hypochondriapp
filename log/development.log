Cardiac malformations encompass defects of the endocardial cushion ranging from abnormalities of the mitral or tricuspid valves to a complete atrioventricular canal, and/or conotruncal defects. The cardiac malformations are the most important symptom in the diagnosis of this disease. Cranial features include macrocephaly, a bulging forehead, prominent occiput, large anterior fontanel, ocular hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, downslanting palpebral fissures, cleft palate, and bifid uvula. [3]3C syndrome is believed to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, though the molecular basis is unknown.[2] Since it was first reported, at least 20 individuals with this condition.[3] Canadian native Indians have a relatively high frequency of 3C syndrome. [3]Diagnostic criteria used to diagnose patients with normal chromosomes:Some additional symptoms include:There is an overlap between 3C syndrome and Joubert syndrome. Both have symptoms of hypotonia and retarded development. Patients with Joubert syndrome have been reported to have cardiac defects typical of 3C syndrome; a patient with 3C syndrome had hyperpneic episodes and abnormal eye movements typical of Joubert syndrome.Another differential diagnosis can be Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, also known as G syndrome. Patients with this condition have reported cardiac defects and cerebellar malformations. 3C syndrome and G syndrome share the same craniofacial features.CHARGE syndrome can also be misdiagnosed. This is because both CHARGE syndrome and 3C syndrome share symptoms of ocular colobomas, cardiac defects, growth retardation, and minor facial abnormalities. [2][3]3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, but the molecular etiology is unknown.Because 3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, A couple who had a first child with 3C syndrome has a 25% risk of a subsequent child having this disease.The outcome of this disease is dependent on the severity of the cardiac defects. About 1 in 3 children with this disease died due to cardiac manifestations early in childhood. About 1/3 of children required shunting for the hydrocephaly. Surgery is often required to repair malformations. Patients with growth-hormone deficiency require growth hormone therapy. Some children required extra assistance due to their retarded psychomotor and speech development.[2][3]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:38 UTC +00:00]]

This syndrome was first described in 2005.[1][2]The clinical phenotype of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome is variable. Clinical features can include mild/moderate mental retardation with mildly dysmorphic facial features (long and narrow face, short philtrum and a high nasal bridge). Of the 6 reported patients, additional features including autism, ataxia, chest-wall deformity and long, tapering fingers were found in at least two patients.[1] A review of 14 children with insterstitial deletions of 3q29, found 11 who had the common recurrent 1.6Mb deletion and displayed mental retardation and microcephaly.[3]The variability of phenotype is underscored by the report on a 6 and 9/12 year-old male patient with a de novo chromosome 3q29 microdeletion identified by BAC array comparative genomic hybridization assay (aCGH), with accompanying normal 46,XY high-resolution chromosome analysis. The patient has language-based learning disabilities and behavioral features consistent with diagnoses of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of the inattentive type. He also displays some other features previously associated with chromosome 3q29 microdeletion such as an elongated face, long fingers, and joint laxity. Most notably the patient, per formal IQ testing, was not found to have frank mental retardation as has been previously reported among patients with chromosome 3q29 terminal deletion, but rather the patient has demonstrated an average full-scale IQ result. This report further expands the phenotypic spectrum to include the possibility of normal intelligence as corroborated by formal, longitudinal psycho-educational testing.[4]The presence of two homologous low copy repeats either side of the deletion break-point suggests that nonallelic homologous recombination is the likely mechanism underlying this syndrome.Research on the risk for developing schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jewish and other populations showed that 3q29 microdeletion syndrome leads to a significant higher rate of schizophrenia.[5]The microdeletion, around 1.6 million base pairs, in length and encompasses 5 known genes and 17 uncharacterised transcripts.

This condition occurs only in females, as there are no Y chromosomes present. Tetrasomy X was first described in 1961, and since then approximately 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Approximately 60 females have been described in medical literature with this condition.[citation needed]Tetrasomy X is a chromosomal aneuploidy, meaning it arises from a defect in meiosis. This can occur when homologous X chromosomes fail to separate in the formation of the egg or sperm. Tetrasomy X is usually suspected based on symptoms present in the individual and is confirmed via karyotyping, which reveals the extra X chromosomes.Symptoms of tetrasomy X are highly variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Physically, tetrasomy X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridges, upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small mouths, cleft or high arched palates, delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study conducted by Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support found that 10% of girls had joint laxity in the hips and 20% had joint limitations in a sample size of 20 tetrasomy and pentasomy patients.Developmentally, tetrasomy X patients frequently show mild delays in the areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo puberty normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical literature reports four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with trisomy 21, one stillborn with omphalocele.In terms of internal organ systems, tetrasomy X patients may have abnormal vision, hearing, circulatory systems, kidneys, or nervous systems. Disorders of the eye include myopia, nystagmus, coloboma, microphthalmus, or optic nerve hypoplasia. In terms of hearing, patients are more prone to ear infections, sound blockage, or nerve abnormalities. Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including ventricular/atrial septal defects, atresia, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and conotruncal or valvular cardiac defects. Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an EEG or MRI.The general prognosis for girls with tetrasomy X is relatively good. Due to the variability of symptoms, some tetrasomy X girls are able to function normally, whereas others will need medical attention throughout their lives. Traditionally, treatment for tetrasomy X has been management of the symptoms and support for learning. Most girls are placed on estrogen treatment to induce breast development, arrest longitudinal growth, and stimulate bone formation to prevent osteoporosis. Speech, occupational, and physical therapy may also be needed depending on the severity of the symptoms.With the Echidna this kind of chromosomal arrangement is normal.

The 8p23.1 duplication is associated with a variable phenotype including one or more of speech delay, developmental delay, mild dysmorphism, with prominent forehead and arched eyebrows, and congenital heart disease (CHD).[2][3]The phenotypic data on 11 patients indicated that cases are not always ascertained for CHD but that CHD was the most common single feature found in 6 out of 11 individuals.[1] Developmental delay and/or learning difficulties were found in 5 out of 11 cases, but one prenatal case was developing normally at 15 months of age (Case 1,[3]). Three other prenatal cases could not yet be reliably assessed. A variable degree of facial dysmorphism was present in 5 out of 11 individuals. Partial toe syndactyly has been found in one mother and son diad and adrenal anomalies in two probands but not in the duplicated mother of one of them. The phenotype is compatible with independent adult life with varying degrees of support. Duplication of the GATA4 transcription factor (OMIM: 600576) is believed to underlie the congenital heart disease and other genes, common to the duplication and deletion syndromes, can be regarded as candidates for the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome. These include the SOX7 transcription factor (OMIM: 612202) for both CHD [4] and developmental delay [5] and the TNKS gene (OMIM: 603303) for behavioural difficulties. The diaphragmatic hernia found in the 8p23.1 deletion syndrome has not been found in the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome to date. The duplication may be associated with copy number changes of the adjacent olfactory receptor/defensin repeats (ORDRs) that predispose to the 8p23.1 deletion and duplication syndromes. High total copy numbers of these repeats have been associated with predisposition to psoriasis[6] and low copy number with predisposition to Crohn's disease.[7]The duplication includes ~3.75 Mb between the distal and proximal ORDRs at either end of band 8p23.1. The copy number of the adjacent repeats may also be altered. The 8p23.1 duplication syndrome cannot be distinguished using conventional cytogenetics from high level copy number variation of the repeats themselves.[1][2]Both de novo cases and families with transmitted duplications from parents of both sex are known. The duplication is believed to arise de novo as a result of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between the proximal and distal ORDRs. NAHR is also thought to give rise to the reciprocal microdeletion syndrome, the polymorphic inversion between the ORDRs and a variety of other large scale abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 8.[6]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:39 UTC +00:00]]

The physical phenotype varies with age and postpuberal males may have only minor remnant manifestations of the prepuberal phenotype.Aarskog–Scott syndrome is transmitted in an X-linked recessive manner. The sons of female carriers are at 50% risk of being affected with the syndrome. The daughters of female carriers are at 50% risk of being carriers themselves. Females may have mild manifestations of the syndrome. The syndrome is caused by mutation in a gene called FGDY1 in band p11.21 on the X chromosome.The Aarskog–Scott syndrome is due to mutation in the FGD1 gene. FGD1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates Cdc42, a member of the Rho (Ras homology) family of the p21 GTPases. By activating Cdc42, FGD1 protein stimulates fibroblasts to form filopodia, cytoskeletal elements involved in cellular signaling, adhesion, and migration. Through Cdc42, FGD1 protein also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade, a pathway that regulates cell growth, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation.Within the developing mouse skeleton, FGD1 protein is expressed in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations, the perichondrium and periosteum, proliferating chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. These results suggest that FGD1 signaling may play a role in the biology of several different skeletal cell types including mesenchymal prechondrocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Aarskog–Scott syndrome.It appears likely that the primary defect in Aarskog–Scott syndrome is an abnormality of FGD1/Cdc42 signaling resulting in anomalous embryonic development and abnormal endochondral and intramembranous bone formation.Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the FGDY1 gene. Genetic counseling is indicated for individuals or families who may carry this condition, as there are overlapping features with fetal alcohol syndrome.[1]Surgery may be required to correct some of the anomalies, and orthodontic treatment may be used to correct some of the facial abnormalities. Trials of growth hormone have been effective to treat short stature in this disorder. To read the details on this new fact, go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14594174.Mild degrees of mental slowness may be present, but affected children usually have good social skills. Some males may exhibit reduced fertility.Some recent findings have included cystic changes in the brain and generalized seizures[citation needed] . There may be difficulty growing in the first year of life in up to one-third of cases. Misaligned teeth may require orthodontic correction. An undescended testicle will require surgery.Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (MIM 103050, ADSL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease causing severe mental retardation and/or autistic features.1,2 Seizures are often observed (80%),3 varying in age of onset (from newborn to late childhood) and nature (tonic-clonic, “suppression burst” pattern, West syndrome, etc.), and are very often resistant to all medication. Around 50% of the children show autistic-like behaviour.4 Microcephaly is rare (1/13 of reported cases). Non-specific anomalies of the brain, such as hypoplasia of the vermis, cerebral atrophy,5 lack of myelination,6 white matter anomalies,7 and lissencephaly4 have often been described.Other Complications: • Low self-esteem • Social difficulties related to physical problems • Male infertility in those with both testes undescended • Problems with the structure of the heart • Accumulation of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema, cystic hygroma) • Failure to thrive in infants.The syndrome is named for Dagfinn Aarskog, a Norwegian pediatrician and human geneticist who first described it in 1970,[2] and for Charles I.

This helped scientists discover that it is the same as type IV Waardenburg syndrome, also known as Shah-Waardenburg Syndrome.In the beginning, medical officials defined ABCD syndrome by the four key characteristics of the syndrome. In the first case study of the Kurdish girl, researches described her as having “albinism and a black lock at the right temporo-occiptital region along Blaschko lines, her eyelashes and brows were white, the irises in her eyes appeared to be blue, she had spots of retinal depigmentation, and she did not react to noise.”[1] The albinism is interesting in this diagnosis because the skin of an affected individual is albino pale besides the brown patches of mispigmented skin. The “black locks” described and seen in clinical pictures of the infants are thick patches of black hair above the ears that form a half circle reaching to the other ear to make a crest shape.As identified in this first case study and stated in a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, ABCD syndrome has many notable features, including “snow white hair in patches, distinct black locks of hair, skin white except brown macules, deafness, irises gray to blue, nystagmus, photophobia, poor visual activity, normal melanocytes in pigmented hair and skin, and absent melanocytes in areas of leukoderma.”[2] Individuals have the blue/gray irises typical of people affected by blindness. The C of ABCD syndrome is what distinguishes this genetic disorder from BADS and it involves cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut. This characteristic occurs when nerve cells do not function correctly in the gut, which results in aganglionosis: The intestines’ failure to move food along the digestive tract. Deafness or being unresponsive to noise due to very low quality of hearing was reported in every case of ABCD syndrome. The characteristics of ABCD syndrome are clearly evident in an inflicted individual.No longer considered a separate syndrome, ABCD syndrome is today considered to be a variation of Shah-Waardenburg type IV. Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is described as “the combination of sensorinerual hearing loss, hypopigmentation of skin and hair, and pigmentary disturbances of the irides.”[3] Hearing loss and deafness, skin mispigmentation and albinism, and pigmentary changes in irises are the similarities between WS and ABCD. According to a dictionary of dermatologic syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome has many notable features, including “depigmentaion of hair and skin - white forelock and prematuring graying of hair, confluent thick eyebrows, heterochromic irides or hypopigmentation of iris, laterally displacy inner canthi, congenital sensorinerual deafness, broad nasal root, autosomal dominant disorder, and other associated findings, including black forelocks.”[2]Researchers in the past 20 years have determined that a gene mutation, specifically a homozygous mutation in the EDNRB gene, is the cause of ABCD syndrome. The advancement of technology led to new DNA material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely. A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes. The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine align on the double strands of DNA. The test results found “an aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene. The mutation was determined to be a homozygous C to T base pair transition at the amino acid level, causing a premature stop in gene translation.”[3] This specialized testing enables geneticists to recognize the gene mutation that is the cause of ABCD syndrome.New findings introduced an important break in the beliefs about ABCD syndrome because the endotherlin B gene is a gene involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. The endothelin receptor B produces Waardenburg syndrome type IV.[4] Researchers began discussing the possibility that ABCD syndrome was in fact not a syndrome; rather it was a type of another syndrome known as Waardenburg. Discovering that the same gene is involved in ABCD and Waardenburg syndrome is important because researchers can now look further into ways to fix this crucial gene.Screening generally only takes place among those displaying several of the symptoms of ABCD, but a study on a large group of institutionalized deaf people in Columbia revealed that 5.38% of them were Waardenburg patients. Because of its rarity, none of the patients were diagnosed with ABCD (Waardenburg Type IV). Nothing can be done to prevent the disease.The occurrence of WS has been reported to be one in 45,000 in Europe. The diagnosis can be made prenatally by ultrasound due to the phenotype displaying pigmentary disturbances, facial abnormalities, and other developmental defects.[5] After birth, the diagnosis is initially made symptomatically and can be confirmed through genetic testing. If the diagnosis is not made early enough, complications can arise from Hirschsprung's disease.Treatment for the disease itself is nonexistent, but there are options for most of the symptoms. For example, one suffering from hearing loss would be given hearing aids, and those with Hirschsprung’s disorder can be treated with a colostomy.If the Hirschsprung's disease is treated in time, ABCD sufferers live otherwise healthy lives. If it is not found soon enough, death often occurs in infancy. For those suffering hearing loss, it is generally regressive and the damage to hearing increases over time. Digestive problems from the colostomy and reattachment may exist, but most cases can be treated with laxatives. The only other debilitating symptom is hearing loss, which is usually degenerative and can only be treated with surgery or hearing aids.Dutch ophthalmologist Petrus Johannes Waardenburg (1886–1979) brought about the idea of Waardenburg syndrome when he examined two deaf twins.[6] Waardenburg decided to define the syndrome with the six major symptoms that patients most commonly had.When scientists further investigated the syndrome, they realized that patients exhibited a wider range of symptoms of this disease in different combinations. This helped them distinguish forms of Waardenburg syndrome. Their evaluation consisted of specifying Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1), type II (WS2), type III (WS3), and type IV (WS4).In 1995, a case study was performed of a Kurdish family. Scientists completed a molecular analysis with DNA strands of the patients diagnosed with ABCD syndrome. Their task was to scan the sequences to find a mutation in the EDNRB gene, one of the most important protein-coding genes. When they completed the scan they “found a homozygous C to T transition resulting, at the amino acid level, in a premature stop codon.”[3] Then, they went back and defined that Shah-Waardenburg syndrome consisted majorly of “mutations in the ENDRB or END3 gene,” along “with [some] SOX10 mutations.”[3] Therefore, the researchers confirmed that ABCD syndrome was a form of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. The genetic tests that they performed on the patients DNA helped in identifying the appropriate diagnosis.In 2002, Whitkop and other scientists examined patients born with white hair, some black locks, and depigmented skin; he diagnosed them as having black lock albinism deafness syndrome (BADS).[1] Those who were closely working with this case suggested that it was an autoimmune disorder rather than a genetic defect. However, soon after, they had a patient who was one of fourteen children of Kurdish parents. The pedigree they examined revealed autosomal-recessive inheritance which led to cell migration of the neurocytes in the gut and, therefore, they redefined the syndrome as ABCD syndrome.[1] This revealed “a homozygous nonsense mutation in the EDNRB gene” meaning that ABCD syndrome was not a separate entity but rather the same as Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.[3]vitiligo: Quadrichrome vitiligo ·  Vitiligo ponctué ·  syndromic (Alezzandrini syndrome ·  Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome)albinism: Oculocutaneous albinism ·  Ocular albinismmelanosome transfer: Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome ·  Chédiak–Higashi syndrome ·  Griscelli syndrome (Elejalde syndrome ·  Griscelli syndrome type 2 ·  Griscelli syndrome type 3)Lentigo/Lentiginosis: Lentigo simplex ·  Liver spot ·  Centrofacial lentiginosis ·  Generalized lentiginosis ·  Inherited patterned lentiginosis in black persons ·  Ink spot lentigo ·  Lentigo maligna ·  Mucosal lentigines ·  Partial unilateral lentiginosis ·  PUVA lentiginesM: INT, SF, LCTanat/phys/devpnoco (i/b/d/q/u/r/p/m/k/v/f)/cong/tumr (n/e/d), sysi/eponproc, drug (D2/3/4/5/8/11)EDAR (EDAR Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:39 UTC +00:00]]

It is caused by a mutation in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in deficiencies in the apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100, which are used in the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons and VLDL respectively. It is not to be confused with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.Abetalipoproteinemia affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and certain vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are molecules that consist of proteins combined with cholesterol and particular fats called triglycerides. This leads to a multiple vitamin deficiency, affecting the fat-soluble vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K.[3] However, many of the observed effects are due to vitamin E deficiency in particular.[3]The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life (because pancreatic lipase is not active in this period). They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea).[3] The stool may contain large chunks of fat and/or blood. Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. They can include poor muscle coordination, difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia),[3][4] and progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye that can progress to near-blindness(due to deficiency of Vitamin A,retinol).[3] Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially vitamin E deficiency, which typically results in eye problems with degeneration of the spinocerebellar and dorsal columns tracts.Often symptoms will arise that indicate the body is not absorbing or making the lipoproteins that it needs. These symptoms usually appear en masse, meaning that they happen all together, all the time. These symptoms come as follows:The initial workup of Abetalipoproteinemia typically consists of stool sampling, a blood smear, and a fasting lipid panel though these tests are not confirmatory.[8] As the disease is rare, though a genetics test is necessary for diagnosis, it is generally not done initially.Acanthocytes are seen on blood smear.[9] Since there is no or little assimilation of chylomicrons, their levels in plasma remains low.The inability to absorb fat in the ileum will result in steatorrhea, or fat in the stool. As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered. Low levels of plasma chylomicron are also characteristic.There is an absence of apolipoprotein B. On intestinal biopsy, vacuoles containing lipids are seen in enterocytes. This disorder may also result in fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Because the epithelial cells of the bowel lack the ability to place fats into chylomicrons, lipids accumulate at the surface of the cell, crowding the functions that are necessary for proper absorption.Mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) gene has been associated with this condition.[3] (Apolipoprotein B deficiency, a related condition, is associated with deficiencies of apolipoprotein B.)[10]The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins.[11] These lipoproteins are both necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and necessary for the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream.[12] Most of the mutations in this gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body.[13] MTTP-associated mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be faulty to produce the disease.[13]Treatment normally consists of rigorous dieting, involving mass amounts of vitamin E.[4] Vitamin E helps the body restore and produce lipoproteins, which people with abetalipoprotenimia usually lack. Vitamin E also helps keep skin and eyes healthy; studies show that many affected males will have vision problems later on in life. Developmental coordination disorder and muscle weakness are usually treated with physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Dietary restriction of triglycerides has also been useful.If treatment is initiated early in disease the neurologic sequelae may be reversed and further deterioration can be prevented.[14]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:39 UTC +00:00]]

Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision disorder, the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight). The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. The only estimate of its relative occurrence of 1:33,000 in the general population dates from the 1960s or earlier.There is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.The syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity and/or their nystagmus. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first 6–7 years of life (but remain near 20/200). The congenital forms of the disorder are considered stationary and do not worsen with age.The five symptoms associated with achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia are:The syndrome of achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts. It became a common term following the popular book by the neuroscientist Oliver Sacks, \"The Island of the Colorblind,\" in 1997. Up to that time most color-blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes. Those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes, deuteranopes or tetartanopes (historically tritanopes).Achromatopsia has also been called rod monochromacy and total congenital color blindness. Individuals with the congenital form of this disorder show complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography at high light levels. There are at least four genetic causes of congenital ACHM, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2/ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.Aside from a complete inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other ophthalmologic aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, nystagmus, and severe photophobia. The fundus of the eye appears completely normal.In general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.Acquired achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon (primarily the thalamus of the mid brain) or the cerebral cortex (the new brain).Thalamic achromatopsia/dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus; it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage.Cerebral achromatopsia is a form of acquired color blindness that is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's retina. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.The known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the retinal phototransduction pathway. Specifically, this form of ACHM seems to result from the inability of cone cells to properly respond to light input by hyperpolarizing. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) as well as the cone cell transducin, GNAT2 (ACHM4).A fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) has been discovered in 2009.[1] It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus 10, 10q24. It is estimated than less than 2% of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene.The hemeralopic aspect of ACHM can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately 100 times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.In general, the molecular pathomechanism of ACHM is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification[disambiguation needed], current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.While some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability.[2] While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface.[3] Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.[2]While very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional, table 2. This will largely result in haploinsufficiency, though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane.[7][8] The three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity.[8] The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP.[7][8] It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.Upon activation by light, rhodopsin causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) α-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated α-subunit from the inhibitory β/γ-subunits. This α-subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3 channels. As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, table 3, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, rhodopsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.There is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, since 2003, there is a cybernetic device called eyeborg that allows people to perceive color through sound waves.[14] Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use such a device in early 2004, the eyeborg allowed him start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color.[15]Moreover, there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans. See Gene therapy for color blindness for more details about it.Achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people (0.0033%).[16] However, in the small Micronesian atoll of Pingelap approximately 5% of the atoll's 3000 inhabitants are afflicted.[17][18]In approximately 1775 Typhoon Lengkieki struck and devastated the Micronesian atoll of Pingelap. The typhoon and ensuing famine left only around 20 survivors, one of whom was heterozygous for achromatopsia. Four generations after this population bottleneck the prevalence of achromatopsia is 5% with a further 30% as carriers. The people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in Pingelapese. This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, The Island of the Colour-blind.[18][19]Steppenwolf front man John Kay suffers from achromatopsia.M: EYEanat (g/a/p)/phys/devp/protnoco/cong/tumr, eponproc, drug (S1A/1E/1F/1L)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:40 UTC +00:00]]

The size of the lesion is variable and may range from solitary round hairless patches to complete exposure of the cranial contents. There may also be varying degrees of terminal transverse defects (for example, shortened digits) of either the upper extremities, lower extremities, or both. Individuals with AOS may have mild growth deficiency, with height in the lower normal percentiles. The skin is frequently observed to have a mottled appearance (cutis marmorata). Other congenital anomalies, including cardiovascular malformations, cleft lip and/or palate, abnormal renal system, and mental retardation are observed in a fraction of affected individuals. Variable defects in blood vessels have also been described, including hypoplastic aortic arch, middle cerebral artery, pulmonary arteries. Other vascular abnormalities described in AOS include absent portal vein, portal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, abnormal umbilical veins, and dilated renal veins.AOS was initially described as having autosomal dominant inheritance due to the reports of families with multiple affected family members in more than one generation. The severity of the condition can vary between family members, suggestive of variable expressivity and reduced penetrance of the disease-causing allele. Subsequently, it was reported that some cases of AOS appear to have autosomal recessive inheritance, perhaps with somewhat more severe phenotypic effects. Three AOS genes have been identified, ARHGAP31, DOCK6, and RBPJ. The first two genes listed regulate proteins CDC421 and RAC1.The precise mechanism underlying the congenital abnormalities observed in AOS is unknown. Similar terminal transverse limb anomalies and cardiovascular malformations are seen in animal models of hypoxic insults during the first trimester.[1][2] Combined with the common association of cardiac and vascular abnormalities in AOS, it has been hypothesized that the spectrum of defects observed in AOS could be due to a disorder of vasculogenesis.So far, the disease-causing genetic defect in AOS has not been definitively identified. In rare cases, AOS can be associated with chromosomal translocations. A panel of candidate genes (including ALX4, CART1, MSX1, MSX2, P63, RUNX2 and HOXD13) have been tested but no disease-causing mutations have been identified.[3][4]The diagnosis of AOS is a clinical diagnosis based on the specific features described above. A system of major and minor criteria was proposed.[5]The combination of two major criteria would be sufficient for the diagnosis of AOS, while a combination of one major and one minor feature would be suggestive of AOS. There is currently no genetic testing that can be performed in order to confirm or rule out this condition.Management of AOS is largely symptomatic and aimed at treating the various congenital anomalies present in the individual. When the scalp and/or cranial bone defects are severe, early surgical intervention with grafting is indicated.The overall prognosis is excellent in most cases. However, individuals with more severe scalp and cranial defects may experience complications such as hemorrhage and meningitis, leading to long-term disability.AOS is a rare genetic disorder and the annual incidence or overall prevalence of AOS is unknown.

A. Andrews, P. M. Conneally and Jans Muller) of the original publication.[1][2]It is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by congenital malformations, contractures of the thumb and fee, a typical facial appearance, and normal cognitive development. This is caused by mutation in the CHST14 (CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 14) gene[3]This is an extremely rare syndrome of brain and respiratory tract malformations incompatible with life beyond a few months. Infants have microcephaly with craniostenosis and dysmyelination of the brain. The thumbs are adducted and do not extend during the Moro reflex. There may be generalized hypotonia, cleft palate (or at least a high arch), arthrogryposis, swallowing and breathing difficulties from respiratory tract malformations, hypertrichosis, and a myopathic stiff face.The disease was documented in 1971 by Dr. Joe Christian and three associates after examining three Amish siblings.[5] Evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance comes from three Amish sibships whose parents all shared a common ancestor. No genomic studies have been done on these families. The relationship of this disorder to the X-linked MASA syndrome (#303350), another adducted thumb disorder, is unknown. Respiratory disease and CNS dysmyelination are not part of the MASA syndrome which seems to be a form of spastic paraplegia with less severe neurological signs than found in the Amish cases.[6]All six parents shared a common ancestral couple, making this a possible issue with consanguinity.[7] Inheritance is believed to be autosomal recessive,[7] caused by mutation in the CHST14 (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14) gene.[8]This syndrome is characterized by typical facial appearance, slight build, thin and translucent skin, severely adducted thumbs, Arachnodactyly (a condition in which the fingers are long and slender and curved. It appears as spider legs), clubfeet, joint instability, facial clefting, and bleeding disorders, as well as heart, kidney, or intestinal defects. Severe psychomotor and developmental delay and decreased muscle tone may also be present during infancy. Cognitive development during childhood is normal.[9]This syndrome is associated with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and cleft palate and various craniofacial, respiratory, neurological, and limb abnormalities, including bone and joint defects of the upper limbs, adducted thumbs, camptodactyly, and talipes equinovarus or calcaneovalgus. Patients with the disease are considered intellectual disability, and most die in childhood. Patients often suffer from respiratory difficulties, such as pneumonia, and from seizures due to dysmyelination in the white matter.[10] It has been hypothesized that the Moro reflex (startle reflex in infants) may be a tool in detecting the congenital clapsed thumb early in infancy.[11] The thumb will normally extend as a result of this reflex.Small head, Premature fusion of skull bones, Arthryogryposis, Cleft palate, Craniofacial abnormalitiesThis syndrome is associated with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and cleft palate and various craniofacial, respiratory, neurological, and limb abnormalities, including bone and joint defects of the upper limbs, adducted thumbs, camptodactyly, and talipes equinovarus or calcaneovalgus.

Linkage studies have shown linkage to markers in the Xq28 band.Case no. 1: Mickaël was examined at the age of 3 yr 4 mo. He was intellectual disability (IQ = 40), aphasic, and had spastic gait, moderate facial dysmorphy and adducted thumbs. His parents were normal, except that his mother had similar facial dysmorphy. His brain CT scan was normal. Case no. 2: Philippe was the elder brother of Mickaël. When examined at the age of 5 years, he had the same features as his brother. His IQ was 40. His brain-CT scan was also normal. DNA analysis with markers for the Xq28 area showed that the brothers had received different X chromosomes from their mother.DNA studies suggest that the MASA syndrome is heterogeneous[13]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:40 UTC +00:00]]

This deficiency results in an accumulation of deoxyadenosine,[5] which, in turn, leads to:Because T cells undergo proliferation and development in the thymus, affected individuals typically have a small, underdeveloped thymus.[6] As a result, the immune system is severely compromised or completely lacking.The enzyme adenosine deaminase is encoded by a gene on chromosome 20.

It a recessive genetic metabolic disorder that affects approximately 1–2% of populations of European descent.[1] It appears to be considerably rarer in Asian populations.[1] The genetic form is caused by a defect in the gene for AMP deaminase[1] though there is also an acquired form of AMP deficiency.AMP deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process. It is a part of the metabolic process that converts sugar, fat, and protein into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the mitochondria. Cellular processes, especially muscles, then convert the ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.[citation needed]During heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase — so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the Purine nucleotide cycle. Normally, excess AMP builds up in the cell and is eventually metabolized in the liver. In persons with a defective enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of cellular and circulating adenosine by 16x - 25x.[2][3]This failure to deaminate the AMP molecules has three major effects. First, significant amounts of AMP are lost from the cell and the body. Second, ammonia is not freed when the cell does work. Third, the level of IMP in the cell is not maintained.The majority of people with the AMPD gene are asymptomatic, but others have symptoms including early fatigue, muscle pain and muscle cramping.[5]It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently than normal individuals.[12]Symptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day. and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.[13][14]Creatine monohydrate is also helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue.[15] There is also clinical association of various muscular dystrophies with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which needs further clinical study for confirmation.There is an increased risk that statin (cholesterol reducing drugs) will cause myopathy (muscle weakness) in individuals with MADD.[16]Anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia, an uncontrolled increase in body temperature, and permanent muscle damage in patients with MADD. Individuals with MADD are advised to notify their an anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery.[8]In most where myopathy is present with MADD, a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation.[17][18]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:40 UTC +00:00]]

ASL catalyzes two distinct reactions in the synthesis of purine nucleotides, both of which involve the β-elimination of fumarate to produce either aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) from SAICAR or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from S-AMP.The deficiency is responsible for a range of symptoms that involve psychomotor retardation, often accompanied by epileptic seizures, and autistic features. Most patients suffer from moderate to severe retardation, while rare patients display only mild psychomotor retardation. Two common theories were proposed to account for these effects. The first is that they result from decreased concentrations of purine nucleotides needed for purine biosynthesis. Decreased concentrations, however, could not be found in various tissues taken from ASL-deficient patients, probably because purines are furnished via the purine salvage pathway and some residual activity of ASL.[3] The second is the buildup of accumulating succinylpurines causes neurotoxic effects. In the severely affected patients, the concentration levels of SAICA riboside and S-Ado are comparable, whereas in patients with milder forms of the disease, the ratio of S-Ado is more than double that of those more severely affected, while SAICA riboside concentration levels remain comparable. This suggests SAICA riboside is the major contributor, while S-Ado may protect against SAICA riboside’s toxic effects.[3]Biochemical studies of the enzyme have focused on proteins of ASL from nonhuman species. The ASL structure from the crystallized protein of Thermotoga maritima has been used, along with DNA sequencing data, to construct homology models for a variety of other organisms, including human ASL.[4] A variety of studies have been done using the equivalent enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, which shares 27% identity along with about 17% similarity in amino acid sequence with the human enzyme.[4] Homology models overlaid on each other show a high degree of overlap between the enzymes. The family of enzymes to which ASL belongs and that catalyze β-eliminations in which fumarate is one of the products are homotetramers with four active sites composed of amino acid residues from three distinct subunits.[5] Much is known about the active site of human ASL due to studies of the active site in the B. subtilis ASL through affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis. While there is quite a bit of variability among species in the sequencing of ASL, the active site of the enzyme contains many residues that are conserved across species and have been shown to be critical to the enzyme’s function. His68 and His141 seem to serve as the general acid and general base catalysts, respectively, and are critical to the catalyzing reaction of the substrate.[6] His89 seems to enhance the binding of the substrate’s phosphoryl group and orient adenylosuccinate for catalysis.[7] All three histidines are conserved throughout the 28 species for which the structure of ASL is known. Glu275 and Lys268 have also been shown to contribute to the active site, indicating there are four active sites, each of which is formed from regions of three subunits.[5] ASL deficiency in different patients is often caused by different mutations to the enzyme. More than 30 different mutations in the ASL gene have been discovered worldwide. The mutations resulting in this deficiency are spread throughout the enzyme, with the majority located far from the active site, suggesting thermal instability, rather than catalytic impairment of the active site, is the most frequent cause of the deficiency.[8]As of 2004, about 60 patients had been diagnosed with ASL deficiency, but many more are thought to be undiagnosed, due to the heterogeneity of the disease and a paucity of general screening. Patients have been diagnosed from a number of areas around the world, although a large number of them are from the Low Countries. ASL deficiency rose to prominence in the well documented case of Michael Dignan, a developmentally challenged youth[citation needed].

These lipomas mainly occur on the trunk, the upper arms and upper legs. The understanding of the cause and mechanism of Dercum disease remains unknown.[2] Possible etiologies include: nervous system dysfunction, mechanical pressure on nerves, adipose tissue dysfunction and trauma.[3]Dercum's Disease was originally described in the medical literature in 1892 by the American doctor Francis Xavier Dercum.[4] Currently, the foremost authority on Dercum's Disease is Dr. Karen Herbst, M.D., Ph.D.Dercum’s disease most commonly appears between the ages of 35 and 50 years of age.[3] It is five to thirty times more common in women than in men.[3] Originally, Dercum proposed that the condition mainly affects postmenopausal women. However, a 2007 survey has revealed that 85.7 percent of the included patients developed Dercum’s disease before menopause.[3] The prevalence of Dercum’s disease has not yet been exactly established.[3]Multiple lipomas and neuropathic pain are the cardinal symptoms of this disease. The associated symptoms in Dercum’s disease include obesity, fatty deposits, easy bruisability, sleep disturbances, impaired memory, depression, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, diabetes, bloating, constipation, fatigue, weakness and joint and muscle aches. [5] Regarding the associated symptoms in Dercum’s disease, only case reports have been published. No study involving medical examinations has been performed in a large group of patients.[3]The aetiology of the disease is unknown. Proposed, but unconfirmed aetiologies include: nervous system dysfunction, mechanical pressure on nerves, adipose tissue dysfunction and trauma.[3]A diagnosis of Dercum's disease is based on patient history and the physical findings. There are no specific laboratory test for this disease. Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging can play a role in diagnosis.[6]Few convincing large studies on the treatment of Dercum’s disease have been conducted. Most of the different treatment strategies that exist are based on case reports.[3] Treatment of Dercum's disease is usually targeted towards pain relief rather than lipoma removal. Currently, there is a lack of scientific data on the use of integrative therapies for the treatment or prevention of Dercum's disease.[7] There are not enough studies done to prove that diet and supplements could help with the disease.[8]Treatment methods include:Surgical excision of fatty tissue deposits around joints (liposuction) has been used in some cases.[9] It may temporarily relieve symptoms although recurrences often develop.Traditional analgesics The pain in Dercum’s disease is often reported to be refractory to analgesics and to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs}. However, this has been contradicted by the findings of Herbst et al. They reported that the pain diminished in 89% of patients (n=89) when treated with NSAIDs and in 97% of patients when treated with narcotic analgesics (n=37). The dosage required and the duration of the pain relief are not precisely stated in the article.[3]Lidocaine An early report from 1934 showed that intralesional injections of procaine (Novocain®) relieved pain in six cases. More recently, other types of local treatment of painful sites with lidocaine patches (5%) (Lidoderm®) or lidocaine/prilocaine (25 mg/25 mg) cream (EMLA®) have shown a reduction of pain in a few cases.[3]In the 1980s, treatment with intravenous infusions of lidocaine (Xylocaine®) in varying doses was reported in nine patients. The resulting pain relief lasted from 10 hours to 12 months. In five of the cases, the lidocaine treatment was combined with mexiletine (Mexitil®), which is a class 1B anti-arrhythmic with similar pharmacological properties as lidocaine. The mechanism by which lidocaine reduces pain in Dercum’s disease is unclear. It may block impulse conduction in peripheral nerves, and thereby disconnect abnormal nervous impulse circuits. Nonetheless, it might also depress cerebral activity that could lead to increased pain thresholds. Iwane et al. performed an EEG during the administration of intravenous lidocaine. The EEG showed slow waves appearing 7 minutes after the start of the infusion and disappearing within 20 minutes after the end of the infusion. On the other hand, the pain relief effect was the greatest at about 20 minutes after the end of the infusion.[3]Based on this, the authors concluded that the effect of lidocaine on peripheral nerves most likely explains why the drug has an effect on pain in Dercum’s disease. In contrast, Atkinson et al. have suggested that an effect on the central nervous system is more likely, as lidocaine can depress consciousness and decrease cerebral metabolism. In addition, Skagen et al. demonstrated that a patient with Dercum’s disease lacked the vasoconstrictor response to arm and leg lowering, which indicated that the sympathicusmediated local veno-arteriolar reflex was absent. This could suggest increased sympathetic activity. An infusion of lidocaine increased blood flow in subcutaneous tissue and normalised the vasoconstrictor response when the limbs were lowered. The authors suggested that the pain relief was caused by a normalisation of up-regulated sympathetic activity.[3]Methotrexate and infliximab One patient’s symptoms were improved with methotrexate and infliximab (Remicade). However, in another patient with Dercum’s disease, the effect of methotrexate was discreet. The mechanism of action is unclear. Previously, methotrexate has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury in a study on rats. The mechanism in the rat study case was thought to be a decrease in microglial activation subsequent to nerve injury. Furthermore, a study has shown that infliximab reduces neuropathic pain in patients with central nervous system sarcoidosis. The mechanism is thought to be mediated by tumour necrosis factor inhibition. [3]Interferon α-2b Two patients were successfully treated with interferon α-2b. The authors speculated on whether the mechanism could be the antiviral effect of the drug, the production of endogenous substances, such as endorphins, or interference with the production of interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor. Interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor are involved in cutaneous hyperalgesia.[3]Corticosteroids A few patients noted some improvement when treated with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone), whereas others experienced worsening of the pain. Weinberg et al. treated two patients with juxta-articular Dercum’s disease with intralesional injections of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol). The patients experienced a dramatic improvement. The mechanism for the pain-reducing ability of corticosteroids in some conditions is unknown. One theory is that they inhibit the effects of substances, such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. As the aetiology of Dercum’s disease is probably not inflammatory, it is plausible that the improvement some of the patients experience when using corticosteroids is not caused by an anti-inflammatory effect.[3]CVAC sessions Dr. Karen Herbst conducted a pilot study utilizing CVAC™ sessions in 2010. A touch-free method was utilized, which is delivered via a high-performance altitude simulator, the Cyclic Variations in AltitudeConditioning™ (CVAC™) process. As a pilot study, 10 participants with AD completed pain and quality of life questionnaires before and after 20–40 minutes of CVAC process daily for 5 days.  The Cyclic Variations in Altitude Conditioning™ (CVAC™)(CVAC™ Systems, Inc; Temecula, California, USA) process is an alternative and potentially revolutionary method of touch free cyclic hypobaric pneumatic compression for treatment of tissue edema and, therefore, edema-associated pain [4].

The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogenous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately one-third of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein, located on the X chromosome. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0). The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. Treatment options for ALD are limited. Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil. For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course. Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated. ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:20,000 and 1:50,000. It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.ALD is a clinically heterogeneous disease. The different clinical presentations are complicated by the pattern of X-linked recessive inheritance. There have been seven phenotypes described in male patients with ABCD1 mutations and five in females.[1] Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability, hyperactivity and disruptive behavior at school. Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms. Untreated, cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death.[2] Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness, paraparesis and sexual dysfunction.[3] All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency.[2] There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop, with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families.[4] Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom, appearing as early as two years of age.[3]The clinical presentation of ALD can vary greatly, making diagnosis difficult. With the variety of phenotypes, clinical suspicion of ALD can result from a variety of different presentations. Symptoms vary based on the disease phenotype, and even within families or between twins.[4] When ALD is suspected based on clinical symptoms, the initial testing usually includes plasma very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) determination using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The concentration of unsaturated VLCFA, particularly 26 carbon chains are significantly elevated in males with ALD, even prior to the development of other symptoms.[5] Confirmation of ALD after positive plasma VLCFA determination usually involves molecular genetic analysis of ABCD1. In females, where plasma VLCFA measurement is not always conclusive (some female carriers will have normal VLCFA in plasma),[5] molecular analysis is preferred, particularly in cases where the mutation in the family is known.[1][3] Although the clinical phenotype is highly variable among affected males, the elevations of VLCFA are present in all males with an ABCD1 mutation.[3]Because the characteristic elevations associated with ALD are present at birth, well before any symptoms are apparent, there have been methods developed[6][7] in the interests of including it in newborn screening programs.[8] One of the difficulties with ALD as a disease included in universal newborn screening is the difficulty in predicting the eventual phenotype that an individual will express. The accepted treatment for affected boys presenting with the cerebral childhood form of the disease is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure which carries significant risks.[2][9] However, because most affected males will demonstrate adrenal insufficiency, early discovery and treatment of this symptom could potentially prevent complications and allow these patients to be monitored for other treatment in the future, depending on the progression of their disease.[8]The Loes score is a rating of the severity of abnormalities in the brain found on MRI. It ranges from 0 to 34, based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of atrophy in the brain, either localized to specific points or generally throughout the brain. A Loes score of 0.5 or less is classified as normal, while a Loes score of 14 or greater is considered severe. It was developed by neuroradiologist Daniel J. Loes MD and is an important tool in assessing disease progression and the effectiveness of therapy.[10]ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, located at Xq28 and demonstrates X-linked recessive inheritance. The gene ABCD1 encodes a peroxisomal membrane transporter which is responsible for transporting very long chain fatty acid substrate into the peroxisomes for degradation.[11] Mutations in this gene that interfere with this process cause this syndrome.Males with an ABCD1 mutation are hemizygous, as they only have a single X chromosome. Female carriers will typically avoid the most severe manifestations of the disease, but often become symptomatic later in life.[1] Although, the detection of an ABCD1 mutation identifies an individual who is affected with a form of ALD, however there is no genotype - phenotype correlation.[12] Within a family, there will often be several different phenotypes, despite the presence of the same causative mutation. In one case, a family with six affected members displayed five different phenotypes.[1] There are no common mutations that cause ALD, most are private or familial. Almost 600[3] different mutations have been identified, approximately half are missense mutations, one quarter are frameshifts, with in-frame deletions and splicing defects making up the remainder.[1] The incidence of new mutations in ALD (those occurring spontaneously, rather than being inherited from a carrier parent) is estimated at approximately 4.1%, with the possibility that these are due to germline mosaicism.[3]The exact cause for the varied collection of symptoms found in the different ALD phenotypes is not clear. The white matter of the brain, the Leydig cells of the testes and the adrenal cortex are the most severely affected systems.[1] The excess VLCFA can be detected in almost all tissues of the body, despite the localization of symptoms.[1] Successful treatment of the demyelination process that affects the brain with either stem cell transplant or gene therapy does not immediately normalize the VLCFA levels in body tissues.[9] The levels of VLCFA can be normalized by treatment with Lorenzo's oil, but this does not alter the progression of the disease.[2] It is unclear whether the accumulation of VLCFA is associated with the pathogenesis of the disease in a specific way, or if it is a biochemical phenotype, useful for identification.[1]Initial attempts at dietary therapy in ALD involved restricting the intake of very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Dietary intake is not the only source for VLCFA in the body, as they are also synthesized endogenously. This dietary restriction did not impact the levels of VLCFA in plasma and other body tissues.[2] After the realization that endogenous synthesis was an important contribution to VLCFA in the body, efforts at dietary therapy shifted to inhibiting these synthetic pathways in the body. The parents of Lorenzo Odone, a boy with ALD, spearheaded efforts to develop a dietary treatment to slow the progression of the disease. They developed a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids (glycerol trioleate and glyceryl trierucate in a 4:1 ratio), known as Lorenzo's oil that inhibits elongation of saturated fatty acids in the body.[2][9] Supplementation with Lorenzo's oil has been found to normalize the VLCFA concentrations in the body, although its effectiveness at treating the cerebral manifestations of the disease are still controversial and unproven.[13] Trials with Lorenzo's oil have shown that it does not stop the neurological degradation in symptomatic patients, nor does it improve adrenal function.[2]While dietary therapy has been shown to be effective to normalize the very-long chain fatty acid concentrations in the plasma of individuals with ALD, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants are the only treatment that can stop the demyelination that is the hallmark of the cerebral forms of the disease.[9] In order to be effective, the transplant must be done at an early stage of the disease; if the demyelination has progressed, transplant can worsen the outcome, and increase the rate of decline. While transplants have been shown to be effective at halting the demyelination process in those presenting with the childhood cerebral form of ALD, follow-up of these patients has shown that it does not improve adrenal function.[14]For patients where an appropriate match for a transplant cannot be found, there have been investigations into the use of gene therapy. Appropriate vectors are selected and modified to express wild type ABCD1, which is then transplanted into the patients using a similar procedure as for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.[9] Gene therapy has only been tried on a small number of patients, mainly in France. These patients were only considered for gene therapy after there was no HLA match for a traditional transplant. In two reported cases, the gene therapy was successful, with a resolution of the demyelination process up to two years after the procedure. Although the gene therapy was successful in resolving the neurological symptoms, plasma VLCFA levels remained elevated.[9]Treatment of the adrenal insufficiency that can accompany any of the common male phenotypes of ALD does not resolve any of the neurological symptoms. Hormone replacement is standard for ALD patients demonstrating adrenal insufficiency.[15] Adrenal insufficiency does not resolve with successful transplant; most patients still require hormone replacement.[14]ALD has not been shown to have an increased incidence in any specific country or ethnic group. In the United States, the incidence of affected males is estimated at 1:21,000. Overall incidence of hemizygous males and carrier females is estimated at 1:16,800.[3] The reported incidence in France is estimated at 1:22,000.[1]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)M: CNSanat (n/s/m/p/4/e/b/d/c/a/f/l/g)/phys/devpnoco (m/d/e/h/v/s)/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (N1A/2AB/C/3/4/7A/B/C/D)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:41 UTC +00:00]]

Circulating lymphocytes with an irregular nuclear contour (leukemic cells) are frequently seen. Several lines of evidence suggest that HTLV-1 causes ATL. This evidence includes the frequent isolation of HTLV-1 from patients with this disease and the detection of HTLV-1 proviral genome in ATL leukemic cells. ATL is frequently accompanied by visceral involvement, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and skin lesions. Most patients die within one year of diagnosis.[5]Infection with HTLV-1, like infection with other retroviruses, probably occurs for life and can be inferred when antibody against HTLV-1 is detected in the serum.[citation needed]Transmission of HTLV-1 is believed to occur from mother to child; by sexual contact; and through exposure to contaminated blood, either through blood transfusion or sharing of contaminated needles.[6]Treatment options that have been tried include zidovudine and the CHOP regimen.[7]Pralatrexate has also been investigated.[8] Most therapy is directed towards the cancer rather than the virus itself.[citation needed] Recently, it has been reported that the traditional glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy toward ATL are largely mediated by thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/TXNIP/VDUP1), suggesting the potential use of a TBP-2 inducer as a novel therapeutic target.[9][10]Recently, mogamulizumab (Poteligeo), has been approved for the treatment of ATL in Japan.HTLV-1 infection in the United States appears to be rare. Although little serologic data exist, prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug abusers in New Jersey, and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in New Orleans. It is possible that prevalence of infection is increasing in this risk group. Studies of HTLV-1 antibody indicate that the virus is endemic in southern Japan, in the Caribbean, South America, and in Africa.[citation needed]ATL is relatively uncommon among those infected with HTLV-1. The overall incidence of ATL is estimated at about 1 per 1,500 adult HTLV-1 carriers per year. Those cases that have been reported have occurred mostly among persons from the Caribbean or blacks from the Southeast (National Institutes of Health, unpublished data). There appears to be a long latent period between HTLV-1 infection and the start of ATL.[citation needed]Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation. Pralatrexate is one compound currently under investigations for the treatment of PTCL.[citation needed]Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.[11] How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.

There are no characteristic antibodies in the blood. The symptoms are similar to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases which do have characteristic antibodies, which must be ruled out with tests for those antibodies. Prognosis is usually favorable but pulmonary, cardiovascular, and kidney manifestations may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications.[1] It is treated first with steroids such as prednisone. Drugs that block the action of Interleukin-1, particularly IL-1β, are effective in treating it.The cause of adult-onset Still's disease is not known, but it presumably involves IL-1, since drugs that block the action of IL-1β are effective treatments. Interleukin-18 is expressed at high levels.[1][2]The disease typically presents with arthralgia, fever, a 'salmon-pink' rash, and lymphadenopathy. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) are classically negative and serum ferritin is elevated. Patients experiencing a flare-up from Adult-onset Still's disease usually report extreme fatigue, swelling of the lymph glands, and less commonly fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart.The diagnosis is clinical, not based upon serology.[3] At least seven sets of diagnostic criteria have been devised, however the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity. Diagnosis requires at least five features, with at least two of these being major diagnostic criteria.[4]One set of 21 adult-onset Still's disease patients were divided into four types, according to clinical course patterns. These included monocyclic systemic disease, polycyclic systemic disease, chronic articular monocyclic systemic disease, and chronic articular polycyclic systemic disease. Chronic articular disease and polyarticular disease were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis.[5]Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, anakinra, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab.Newer drugs target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1β. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. [6] Other anti-IL1β drugs are being developed, including canakinumab and rilonacept.[7]The condition \"juvenile-onset Still's disease\" is now usually grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is some evidence that the two conditions are closely related.[8]Adult-onset Still's Disease is rare and has been described all over the world. Prevalence is estimated at 1.5 cases per 100,000-1,000,000 population. There is a bimodal age distribution with one peak incidence between ages 15–25 and a second peak between ages of 36–46 years.[9]Still's disease is named after English physician Sir George Frederic Still (1861–1941).[10][11] It was characterized by EG Bywaters in 1971.[12]M: JNTanat (h/c, u, t, l)/physnoco (arth/defr/back/soft)/cong, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M01C, M4)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:41 UTC +00:00]]

Problems associated with the disorder generally become evident in infancy or early childhood. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the estimated prevalence of Alagille syndrome is 1 in every 100,000 live births.It is named for Daniel Alagille.[1][2]The severity of the disorder can vary within the same family, with symptoms ranging from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe heart and/or liver disease requiring transplantation.Signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in Alagille syndrome may include a yellowish tinge in the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itching (pruritis), and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). A liver biopsy may indicate too few bile ducts (bile duct paucity) or, in some cases, the complete absence of bile ducts (biliary atresia). Other signs of Alagille syndrome include congenital heart problems, an unusual butterfly shape of one or more of the bones of the spinal column that can be seen in an x-ray, certain eye defects, and narrowed pulmonary arteries that can contribute to increased pressure on the right heart valves.Tetralogy of Fallot is a heart defect common in Alagille's syndrome patients. This defect consists of four separate heart abnormalities: Pulmonary stenosis; overriding aorta; ventricular septal defect; and right ventricular hypertrophy. Untreated Tetralogy of Fallot mortality rates range from 70 percent by age 10 to 95 percent by age 40. However, complete surgical repair can significantly improve both longevity and quality of life in Allagille's patients.Many people with Alagille syndrome have similar facial features, including a broad, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a small pointed chin. The kidneys and central nervous system may also be affected.Microdeletion of the 20p12 gene corresponding to JAG1 results in Alagille syndrome, similar to the inheritance pattern of Williams syndrome.[3] The JAG1 gene is involved in signaling between adjacent cells during embryonic development. This signaling influences how the cells are used to build body structures in the developing embryo. Mutations in JAG1 disrupts the Notch signaling pathway, causing errors in development, especially of the heart, bile ducts in the liver, spinal column, eyes, blood vessels and certain facial features.NOTCH2 mutations are also associated with Alagille syndrome.[4]Narrowed and malformed bile ducts in the liver produce many of the health problems associated with Alagille syndrome. Bile is produced in the liver and moves through the bile ducts into the small intestine, where it helps to digest fat. In Alagille syndrome, the bile builds up in the liver and causes scarring that prevents the liver from working properly to eliminate wastes from the bloodstream.This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.There is no known cure for Alagille's Syndrome. Most of the treatments available are aimed at improving the functioning of the heart and reducing the effects of impaired liver, kidney, and spleen function.Several medications are used to improve bile flow and reduce itching (pruritus): ursodiol (Actigall), hydroxyzine (Atarax), cholestyramine, rifampicin, and phenobarbital have all been used with varying degrees of success.Many patients with Alagille's Syndrome will also benefit from a high dose of a multivitamin such as ADEK (continuing high levels of vitamins A, D, E, and K), as the reduced bile flow makes it difficult to absorb and utilize these vitamins.Corrective surgery is sometimes needed to repair heart defects associated with Alagille Syndrome. Also, because the pulmonary arteries are often narrow in patients with Alagille syndrome, a catheterization process similar to angioplasty may be used to widen the arteries to reduce pressure on the heart's pumping valves. In moderate to severe cases, stents may be placed in the arteries to increase their diameter. Transplantation of the liver has been a successful alternative to medication in severe cases.Partial biliary diversion has been used to significantly reduce pruritus, jaundice, and xanthomas caused by poor bile flow in patients with bile duct paucity. A portion of the bile produced by the liver is directed through a surgically created stoma into a plastic pouch on the patient's lower right abdomen. The pouch is periodically drained as it fills with bile.Patients with biliary atresia may require a Kasai procedure to improve bile drainage; however, later liver transplantation is still often necessary.M: MOUanat/devpnoco/cofa (c)/cogi/tumr, sysiproc (peri), drug (A1)M: DIGanat (t, g, p)/phys/devp/enzynoco/cong/tumr, sysi/eponproc, drug (A2A/2B/3/4/5/6/7/14/16), blteThis article incorporates public domain text from The U.S. National Library of Medicine"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:41 UTC +00:00]]

It is a very rare disorder which results from a genetic mutation and mostly affects infants and children, causing developmental delay and changes in physical characteristics.[1][2][3]Alexander disease is a genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system (midbrain and cerebellum). It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)[4][5][6] that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an Autosomal Dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the condition[2]Alexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases which affect growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.[2][3][7]Rosenthal fibers appear not to be present in healthy people,[3][8] but occur in specific diseases, like some forms of cancer.[3][8] The Rosenthal fibers found in Alexander disease are not distributed in the same areas or as concentrated when compared to other diseases and disorders.[3]Delays in development of some physical, psychological and behavioral skills, progressive enlargement of the head (macrocephaly), seizures, spasticity, in some cases also hydrocephalus, dementia.[2]Alexander disease causes the affected person to slowly begin to lose body function and eventually the ability to talk. It also causes an overload of long chain fatty acids that the body cannot dispose of. This overload of fatty acids builds up in the brain and destroys the myelin sheath. The cause of Alexander disease is a mutation in the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein.[2][3][4][5][9]CT shows:It is possible to detect the signs of Alexander disease with Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease.[10][11] It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MR imaging.[9] Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for the known cause of Alexander disease.[12][13] A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms including, enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies.[8]Its occurrence is very rare. The infantile form from birth to 2 years of age.[6] The average duration of the infantile form of the illness is usually about 3 years. Onset of the juvenile form presents between two and twelve years of age.[6] Duration of this form is in most cases about 6 years. The Adult form from twelve years and older.[6] In younger patients, seizures, megalencephaly, developmental delay, and spasticity are usually present. Neonatal onset is also reported.[14] Onset in adults is least frequent. In older patients, bulbar or pseudobulbar symptoms and spasticity predominate. Symptoms of the adult form may also resemble multiple sclerosis.[2]There are no more than 500 reported cases.[2]There is currently no cure, or standard procedure taken for treatment.[2][3] A bone marrow transplant has been attempted on a child, but did not cause the patient's condition to improve.[15][16]The prognosis is generally poor.

In humans it is known to be caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation.[2] In livestock it is caused by chronic poisoning with swainsonine from locoweed.A defective alpha-mannosidase enzyme, which normally helps to break down complex sugars derived from glycoproteins in the lysosome, causes sugar build up and impairs cell function. Complete absence of functionality in this enzyme leads to death during early childhood due to deterioration of the central nervous system. Enzymes with low residual activity lead to a milder type of the disease, with symptoms like reduced hearing, mental retardation, susceptibility to bacterial infections, and skeletal deformities. The course of the disease is progressive.Alpha-mannosidosis is classified into types I through III based on severity and age of onset. In contrast to the usual classifications scheme of these disorders, type III is the most severe.Symptoms range widely in their onset and severity. The onset of the most severe form, type III, begins within the first months of life and includes a quick progression of mental retardation, liver and spleen enlargement (splenomegaly), hearing loss, respiratory infections and skeletal abnormalities. Often the appearance of an affected individual includes the following facial features: protruding forehead, leveled nasal bridge, small nose and wide mouth. Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build up of storage materials in the muscle. A milder form of alpha-mannosidosis involves mild to moderate mental retardation which develops during childhood or adolescence.A diagnosis is made by measuring the enzymatic activity of alpha-D-mannosidase in white blood cells. If there is a decreased level of the enzyme in comparison to standard levels, a diagnosis can be made. It is thought that this disorder might be under-diagnosed for a few different reasons — the diagnosis is often made late in the disease's progression, symptoms are often mild, or the biochemical diagnosis does not yield conclusive results.The life expectancy in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders may survive well into adult life.There is no cure for congenital alpha-mannosidosis. Treatment is limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of this disorder by, for example, taking medication to control seizures, using a hearing aid to assist with hearing loss, and by having routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness. In some cases, a wheelchair is recommended if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected. Despite early reports to the contrary,[3] bone marrow transplants performed at an early age have shown promise in halting the progression of this disorder.[4]The worldwide incidence of alpha-mannosidosis is in the range of 1 per 500,000[4] to 1 per 1,000,000.

It is among the rarest genetic disorders in the world, as currently it has only 266 reported cases in medical literature and over 501 known cases in 47 countries. It was first described by Carl-Henry Alström in Sweden in 1959. Alstrom syndrome is sometimes confused with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has similar symptoms. Bardet-Biedl syndrome tends to have later onset in its symptoms.According to a 2007 article by Joy et al. published in the Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases:\"Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by multiorgan dysfunction. The key features are childhood obesity, blindness due to congenital retinal dystrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Associated endocrinologic features include hyperinsulinemia, early-onset type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, AS shares several features with the common metabolic syndrome, namely obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been found to be causative for AS with a total of 79 disease-causing mutations havingThe Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, USA with the University of Southampton, UK isolated the single gene (ALMS1) responsible for Alström Syndrome. The gene is recessive; it must be passed from both parents for the syndrome to manifest.[citation needed]It is possible to clinically detect Alström syndrome in infancy, but more frequently, it is detected much later, as doctors tend to detect symptoms as separate problems. Currently, Alström syndrome is often diagnosed clinically, since genetic testing is costly and only available on a limited basis.[citation needed]Marshall JD et al. provided a comprehensive guidance for diagnostic criteria in their 2007 publication.Birth – 2 years:Minimum diagnosis requires 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria.Major criteria are: 1) ALMS1 mutation in 1 allele and/or family history of Alström Syndrome 2) Vision pathology (nystagmus, photophobia).Minor criteria are: 1) Obesity 2) Dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.Other variable supportive evidence: Recurrent pulmonary infections, normal digits, delayed developmental milestones.At 3–14 years of age:2 major criteria or 1 major and 3 minor criteria.Major criteria are: 1) ALMS1 mutation in 1 allele and/or family history of Alström Syndrome, 2) Vision pathology (nystagmus, photophobia, diminished acuity).

Thus, Alstrom syndrome is a ciliopathy. Other known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Meckel-Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.[2]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:42 UTC +00:00]]

It is a rare cause of persistent pulmonary hypertension in infants.[1] It also may be a rare cause of pulmonary hypoplasia.[2] Until mid-2012, the only possible outcome was neonatal death, with one of the longest surviving infants living 2 months.[3]Babies with ACD may appear normal at birth but within minutes or hours they develop respiratory distress with persistent pulmonary hypertension.[4] ACD does not respond to standard therapies that resolve simple pulmonary hypertension. The lack of response is an important diagnostic clue.ACD is a genetic disorder. This is known because ACD has been reported in multiple families. There is more than one form of ACD. In some families, a form of ACD known as alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) has been linked to the gene FOXF1 on chromosome 16 q24.1-q24.2.[5]ACD commonly is diagnosed postmortem, by a pathologist.Sometimes ACD is diagnosed clinically.[6] This is common when there is a family history of ACD, but rare otherwise. A clinical differential diagnosis of ACD excludes fetal atelectasis.[4]ACD is not detectable by prenatal imaging. However, some babies with ACD have associated congenital malformations that are detectable by imaging. The identification of genes involved in ACD offers the potential for prenatal testing and genetic counseling.Most babies with ACD have normal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, but within minutes or hours present with hypoxia and upon investigation are found to have hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension. Initial treatments address the hypoxia, usually beginning with supplemental oxygen and arrangements for urgent transport to a neonatal intensive care unit.Therapies that have been tried to extend life include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and nitric oxide. These are supportive therapies for persistent pulmonary hypertension; they do not treat the ACD. The objective of therapy is to keep the baby alive long enough to obtain a lung transplant.[3] To date no such case has been reported.Actress NiCole Robinson and her husband Craig Snyder lost a baby to ACD; with his first wife, Craig lost two more babies to ACD. They have founded an organization to support research into ACD.According to the St. Louis Children's Hospital (the Level I pediatric trauma center and pediatric teaching hospital for the Washington University School of Medicine), which is noted worldwide for its record in pediatric pulmonary transplantation, a type of artificial lung device, the Quadrox, was used after ECMO as a bridge to a dual lung transplant in ten-month-old Eleni Scott of the St. Louis suburb of Florissant, Missouri, who after transplantation returned to her home. Doctors have said it is too early to presume it will continue to work here or work in other pediatric patients as an experiment, much less a successful, curative standard therapy, but the infant has survived thus far, meaning that there might be hope for sufferers of this rare condition.

ALS is the most common of the five motor neuron diseases.The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Unable to function, the muscles weaken and exhibit atrophy. Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement, although bladder and bowel sphincters and the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually, but not always, spared until the terminal stages of the disease.[1]Cognitive function is generally spared for most patients, although some (about 5%) also have frontotemporal dementia.[2] A higher proportion of patients (30–50%) also have more subtle cognitive changes which may go unnoticed, but are revealed by detailed neuropsychological testing. Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected, meaning the majority of people with ALS will maintain hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.The earliest symptoms of ALS are typically obvious weakness and/or muscle atrophy. Other presenting symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; and/or slurred and nasal speech. The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. About 75% of people contracting the disease experience \"limb onset\" ALS, i.e., first symptoms in the arms or legs. Patients with the leg onset form may experience awkwardness when walking or running or notice that they are tripping or stumbling, often with a \"dropped foot\" which drags gently along the ground. Arm-onset patients may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. Occasionally, the symptoms remain confined to one limb for a long period of time or for the whole length of the illness; this is known as monomelic amyotrophy.About 25% of cases are \"bulbar onset\" ALS. These patients first notice difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of patients experience \"respiratory onset\" ALS, where the intercostal muscles that support breathing are affected first. A small proportion of patients may also present with what appears to be frontotemporal dementia, but later progresses to include more typical ALS symptoms.Over time, patients experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations). Around 15–45% of patients experience pseudobulbar affect, also known as \"emotional lability\", which consists of uncontrollable laughter, crying or smiling, attributable to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons resulting in exaggeration of motor expressions of emotion.[citation needed] To be diagnosed with ALS, patients must have signs and symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron damage that cannot be attributed to other causes.Although the order and rate of symptoms varies from person to person, eventually most patients are not able to walk or use their hands and arms. They also lose the ability to speak and swallow their food, whilst most end on a portable ventilator, called BPAP. The rate of progression can be measured using an outcome measure called the \"ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R)\", a 12-item instrument administered as a clinical interview or patient-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability). Though there is a high degree of variability and a small percentage of patients have much slower disease, on average, patients lose about 0.9 FRS point per month. A study amongst clinicians showed that they rated a 20% change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R would be clinically meaningful.[3] Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disease, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. In limb-onset ALS, symptoms usually spread from the affected limb to the opposite limb before affecting a new body region, whereas in bulbar-onset ALS symptoms typically spread to the arms before the legs.Disease progression tends to be slower in patients who are younger than 40 at onset,[4] have disease restricted primarily to one limb, and those with primarily upper motor neuron symptoms.[5] Conversely, progression is faster and prognosis poorer in patients with bulbar-onset disease, respiratory-onset disease, and frontotemporal dementia.[5]Difficulty in chewing and swallowing makes eating very difficult and increases the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disease, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. External ventilation machines that use the ventilation mode of bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) are frequently used to support breathing, initially at night, and later during the daytime as well. The use of BPAP (more often referred to as non-invasive ventilation, NIV) is only a temporary remedy, however, and it is recommended that long before BPAP stops being effective, patients should decide whether to have a tracheotomy and long term mechanical ventilation. At this point, some patients choose palliative hospice care. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.Although respiratory support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within three to five years from the onset of symptoms. The median survival time from onset to death is around 39 months, and only 4% survive longer than 10 years.[6] Physicist Stephen Hawking has lived with the disease for more than 50 years, though he is an unusual case.[7]There is a known hereditary factor in familial ALS (FALS), where the condition is known to run in families. A defect on chromosome 21, which codes for superoxide dismutase, is associated with approximately 20% of familial cases of ALS, or about 2% of ALS cases overall.[8][9][10] This mutation is believed to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, and has over a hundred different forms of mutation. The most common ALS-causing SOD1 mutation in North American patients is A4V, characterized by an exceptionally rapid progression from onset to death. The most common mutation found in Scandinavian countries, D90A, is more slowly progressive than typical ALS and patients with this form of the disease survive for an average of 11 years.[11]In 2011, a genetic abnormality known as a hexanucleotide repeat was found in a region called C9orf72, which is associated with ALS combined with frontotemporal dementia ALS-FTD,[12] and accounts for some 6% of cases of ALS among white Europeans.[13] The high degree of mutations found in patients that appeared to have \"sporadic\" disease, (i.e., without a family history) suggests that genetics may play a more significant role than previously thought and that environmental exposures may be less relevant.To date, a number of genetic mutations have been associated with various types of ALS. The currently known associations are as follows:The precise cause of ALS is still not known, though a first important step toward determining the cause came in 1993 when scientists discovered that mutations in the gene that produces the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme were associated with some cases (approximately 20%) of familial ALS. This enzyme is a powerful antioxidant that protects the body from damage caused by superoxide, a toxic free radical generated in the mitochondria. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules produced by cells during normal metabolism. Free radicals can accumulate and cause damage to both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins within cells. To date, over 110 different mutations in SOD1 have been linked with the disease, some of which have a very long clinical course (e.g. H46R), while others, such as A4V, being exceptionally aggressive. Evidence suggests that failure of defenses against oxidative stress up-regulates programmed cell death (apoptosis), among many other possible consequences. Although it is not yet clear how the SOD1 gene mutation leads to motor neuron degeneration, researchers have theorized that an accumulation of free radicals may result from the faulty functioning of this gene. Current research, however, indicates that motor neuron death is not likely a result of lost or compromised dismutase activity, suggesting mutant SOD1 induces toxicity in some other way (a gain of function).[19][20]Studies involving transgenic mice have yielded several theories about the role of SOD1 in mutant SOD1 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mice lacking the SOD1 gene entirely do not customarily develop ALS, although they do exhibit an acceleration of age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) and a shortened lifespan (see article on superoxide dismutase). This indicates that the toxic properties of the mutant SOD1 are a result of a gain in function rather than a loss of normal function. In addition, aggregation of proteins has been found to be a common pathological feature of both familial and sporadic ALS (see article on proteopathy). Interestingly, in mutant SOD1 mice (most commonly, the G93A mutant), aggregates (misfolded protein accumulations) of mutant SOD1 were found only in diseased tissues, and greater amounts were detected during motor neuron degeneration.[21] It is speculated that aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 plays a role in disrupting cellular functions by damaging mitochondria, proteasomes, protein folding chaperones, or other proteins.[22] Any such disruption, if proven, would lend significant credibility to the theory that aggregates are involved in mutant SOD1 toxicity. Critics have noted that in humans, SOD1 mutations cause only 2% or so of overall cases and the etiological mechanisms may be distinct from those responsible for the sporadic form of the disease. To date, the ALS-SOD1 mice remain the best model of the disease for preclinical studies but it is hoped that more useful models will be developed.Where no family history of the disease is present – i.e., in around 90% of cases – there is no known cause for ALS. Potential causes for which there is inconclusive evidence includes head trauma, military service, and participation in contact sports. More recently, some research has suggested that there may be a link between ALS and food contaminated by blue-green algae.[23][unreliable medical source?]Studies also have focused on the role of glutamate in motor neuron degeneration. Glutamate is one of the chemical messengers or neurotransmitters in the brain. Scientists have found that, compared to healthy people, ALS patients have higher levels of glutamate in the serum and spinal fluid.[9]Riluzole is currently the only FDA approved drug for ALS and targets glutamate transporters. It only has a modest effect on survival, however, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease.Certain studies suggested a link between sporadic ALS, specifically in athletes, and a diet enriched with branched-chain amino acids. BCAAs, a common dietary supplement among athletes, cause cell hyper-excitability resembling that usually observed in ALS patients. The proposed underlying mechanism is that cell hyper-excitability results in increased calcium absorption by the cell and thus brings about cell death, specifically of neuronal cells which have particularly low calcium buffering capabilities.[24][25]There is evidence that superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein misfolding propagates between molecules in a similar fashion to prions.[26]Many other potential causes, including chemical exposure, electromagnetic field exposure, occupation, physical trauma, and electric shock, have been investigated but without consistent findings.[27]The defining feature of ALS is the death of both upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex of the brain, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. Prior to their destruction, motor neurons develop proteinaceous inclusions in their cell bodies and axons. This may be partly due to defects in protein degradation.[28] These inclusions often contain ubiquitin, and generally incorporate one of the ALS-associated proteins: SOD1, TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43, or TARDBP), or FUS.No test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive. Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the physician observes in the patient and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.[29] Physicians obtain the patient's full medical history and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, hyperreflexia, and spasticity are getting progressively worse.Because symptoms of ALS can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions. One of these tests is electromyography (EMG), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles. Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS. Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Specific abnormalities in the NCV results may suggest, for example, that the patient has a form of peripheral neuropathy (damage to peripheral nerves) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS. The physician may order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Although these MRI scans are often normal in patients with ALS, they can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, multiple sclerosis, a herniated disk in the neck, syringomyelia, or cervical spondylosis.Based on the patient's symptoms and findings from the examination and from these tests, the physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases as well as routine laboratory tests. In some cases, for example, if a physician suspects that the patient may have a myopathy rather than ALS, a muscle biopsy may be performed.Infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV), Lyme disease,[30]syphilis[31] and tick-borne encephalitis[32] viruses can in some cases cause ALS-like symptoms. Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP, spinal muscular atrophy and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA)can also mimic certain facets of the disease and should be considered by physicians attempting to make a diagnosis.ALS must be differentiated from the \"ALS mimic syndromes\" which are unrelated disorders that may have a similar presentation and clinical features to ALS or its variants.[33] Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early stages of the disease, patients should always obtain a specialist neurological opinion, so that alternative diagnoses are clinically ruled out.However, most cases of ALS are readily diagnosed and the error rate of diagnosis in large ALS clinics is less than 10%.[34][35] In one study, 190 patients who met the MND / ALS diagnostic criteria, complemented with laboratory research in compliance with both research protocols and regular monitoring. Thirty of these patients (16%) had their diagnosis completely changed, during the clinical observation development period.[36] In the same study, three patients had a false negative diagnoses, myasthenia gravis (MG), an auto-immune disease. MG can mimic ALS and other neurological disorders leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MG is eminently treatable; ALS is not.[37] Myasthenic syndrome, also known as Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), can mimic ALS and its initial presentation can be similar to that of MG.[38][39]Current research focuses on abnormalities of neuronal cell metabolism involving glutamate and the role of potential neurotoxins and neurotrophic factors.[40]Riluzole (Rilutek) is the only treatment that has been found to improve survival but only to a modest extent.[41] It lengthens survival by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset. It also extends the time before a person needs ventilation support. Riluzole does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons, and people taking it must be monitored for liver damage (occurring in ~10% of people taking the drug).[42] It is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).Other treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. This supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals working with patients and caregivers to keep patients as mobile and comfortable as possible.Medical professionals can prescribe medications to help reduce fatigue, ease muscle cramps, control spasticity, and reduce excess saliva and phlegm. Drugs also are available to help patients with pain, depression, sleep disturbances, dysphagia, and constipation. Baclofen and diazepam are often prescribed to control the spasticity caused by ALS, and trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline may be prescribed when ALS patients begin having trouble swallowing their saliva.[1]Physical therapists and occupational therapists play a large role in rehabilitation for individuals with ALS. Specifically, physical and occupational therapists can set goals and promote benefits for individuals with ALS by delaying loss of strength, maintaining endurance, limiting pain, preventing complications, and promoting functional independence.[43]Occupational therapy and special equipment such as assistive technology can also enhance patients' independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise such as performing activities of daily living (ADL's), walking, swimming, and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help patients fight fatigue and depression. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles. Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles. They can suggest devices such as ramps, braces, walkers, bathroom equipment (shower chairs, toilet risers, etc.) and wheelchairs that help patients remain mobile. Occupational therapists can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable people to retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as possible.ALS patients who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a speech-language pathologist. These health professionals can teach patients adaptive strategies such as techniques to help them speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech-language pathologists can recommend the use of augmentative and alternative communication such as voice amplifiers, speech-generating devices (or voice output communication devices) and/or low tech communication techniques such as alphabet boards or yes/no signals.Patients and caregivers can learn from speech-language pathologists and nutritionists how to plan and prepare numerous small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, fiber, and fluid and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. Patients may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent choking. Occupational therapists can assist with recommendations for adaptive equipment to ease the physical task of self-feeding and/or make food choice recommendations that are more conducive to their unique deficits and abilities. When patients can no longer get enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach. The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and pneumonia that can result from inhaling liquids into the lungs. The tube is not painful and does not prevent patients from eating food orally if they wish.Researchers have stated that \"ALS patients have a chronically deficient intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake\"[44] and that patients suffer from a severe loss of appetite.[45] Both animal[46] and human research[44][unreliable medical source?][47][unreliable medical source?] suggest that ALS patients should be encouraged to consume as many calories as possible and not to restrict their calorie intake. As of 2012 there remained \"a lack of robust evidence for interventions\" for the management of weight loss.[48]When the muscles that assist in breathing weaken, use of ventilatory assistance (intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), or biphasic cuirass ventilation (BCV)) may be used to aid breathing. Such devices artificially inflate the patient's lungs from various external sources that are applied directly to the face or body. When muscles are no longer able to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, these devices may be used full-time. BCV has the added advantage of being able to assist in clearing secretions by using high-frequency oscillations followed by several positive expiratory breaths.[49] Patients may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. To be effective, this may require a tube that passes from the nose or mouth to the windpipe (trachea) and for long-term use, an operation such as a tracheotomy, in which a plastic breathing tube is inserted directly in the patient's windpipe through an opening in the neck.Patients and their families should consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use one of these options. Ventilation devices differ in their effect on the patient's quality of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Patients need to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support. Some patients under long-term tracheotomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation with deflated cuffs or cuffless tracheotomy tubes (leak ventilation) are able to speak, provided their bulbar muscles are strong enough. This technique preserves speech in some patients with long-term mechanical ventilation. Other patients may be able to utilize a speaking valve such as a Passey-Muir Speaking Valve with the assistance and guidance of a speech-language pathologist.Social workers and home care and hospice nurses help patients, families, and caregivers with the medical, emotional, and financial challenges of coping with ALS, particularly during the final stages of the disease. Social workers provide support such as assistance in obtaining financial aid, arranging durable power of attorney, preparing a living will, and finding support groups for patients and caregivers. Home nurses are available not only to provide medical care but also to teach caregivers about tasks such as maintaining respirators, giving feedings, and moving patients to avoid painful skin problems and contractures. Home hospice nurses work in consultation with physicians to ensure proper medication, pain control, and other care affecting the quality of life of patients who wish to remain at home. The home hospice team can also counsel patients and caregivers about end-of-life issues.ALS is one of the most common neuromuscular diseases worldwide, and people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are affected. One or two out of 100,000 people develop ALS each year.[50] ALS most commonly strikes people between 40 and 60 years of age, but younger and older people can also develop the disease. Men are affected slightly more often than women.Although the incidence of ALS is thought to be regionally uniform, there are three regions in the West Pacific where there has in the past been an elevated occurrence of ALS. This seems to be declining in recent decades. The largest is the area of Guam inhabited by the Chamorro people, who have historically had a high incidence (as much as 143 cases per 100,000 people per year) of a condition called Lytico-Bodig disease which is a combination of symptoms similar to ALS, parkinsonism, and dementia. Lytico-Bodig disease has been linked to the consumption of cycad seeds and in particular, the chemical found in cycad seeds, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).[51] Studies in this field were awarded with the Nobel prize for Dr Gajdusek, Daniel Carleton in 1976 [52] Two more areas of increased incidence are West Papua and the Kii Peninsula of Japan.[53][54]Although there have been reports of several \"clusters\" including three American football players from the San Francisco 49ers, more than fifty football players in Italy,[55] three football-playing friends in the south of England,[56] and reports of conjugal (husband and wife) cases in the south of France,[57][58][59][60][61] these are statistically plausible chance events[citation needed]. Although many authors consider ALS to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, so far the latter have not been firmly identified, other than a higher risk with increasing age.Amyotrophic comes from the Greek language: A- means \"no\", myo refers to \"muscle\", and trophic means \"nourishment\"; amyotrophic therefore means \"no muscle nourishment,\" which describes the characteristic atrophication of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. Lateral identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that are affected are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening (\"sclerosis\") in the region.A number of clinical trials are underway globally for ALS; a comprehensive listing of trials in the US can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov.Thalidomide and lenalidomide have shown efficacy in protecting motor neurons in transgenic (G93A) mice.[65]Dexpramipexole (KNS-760704) was one of the largest phase III study conducted in patients so far by Biogen Idec . In January 2013, Biogen Idec announced that it was discontinuing its development of dexpramipexole in ALS due to lack of efficacy in a phase III study. The results of that study were published November 2013 in The Lancet Neurology.[66]A phase II trial on Tirasemtiv has been completed with a follow-on Phase IIb study in progress under the name \"BENEFIT-ALS\". Results of the first study are available here.[67][unreliable medical source?] The current trial is an international, placebo-controlled, multi-center study on 680 participants. This makes it one of the largest studies to date.A phase II trial on Ozanezumab is in progress. It is a large multi-site international research project sponsored by GSK.A phase II trial on talampanel was completed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in April 2010, however it was found to be negative for treatment viability.[68]A phase II clinical trial is being conducted by BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics at the Hadassah Medical Center in Israel and interim results \"demonstrated a tendency toward stabilization in some parameters in the ALS Functional Rating Scale.\"[69][70] Patients in the trial have bone marrow stem cells removed and differentiated in a clean room into cells that express neurotropic factors. The cells are injected back into the same patient via an intrathecal injection and intramuscular injections. A second phase II trial is expected to open in the United States at several institutions including the Mayo Clinic.[71]A phase I trial using human fetal neural stem cells conducted by Neuralstem, Inc. in 2010–2012 showed \"no significant disease progression\" in a number of participants. A phase II trial of the technology has received FDA approval and is scheduled to commence in 2013.[72] Patients in the phase II trial will receive more injections and a higher number of cells per injection than the phase I trial. The primary endpoint of the trial is the maximum tolerated dose of transplanted cells, and the trial will take place at the University of Michigan and Emory University.[73]M: CNSanat (n/s/m/p/4/e/b/d/c/a/f/l/g)/phys/devpnoco (m/d/e/h/v/s)/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (N1A/2AB/C/3/4/7A/B/C/D)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:42 UTC +00:00]]

There are also physical abnormalities associated with Andersen–Tawil syndrome, these typically affect the head, face, and limbs. These features often include an unusually small lower jaw (micrognathia), low-set ears, and an abnormal curvature of the fingers called clinodactyly.Two types of Andersen–Tawil syndrome are distinguished by their genetic causes.The protein made by the KCNJ2 gene forms a channel that transports potassium ions into muscle cells. The movement of potassium ions through these channels is critical for maintaining the normal functions of skeletal muscles which are used for movement and cardiac muscle. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene alter the usual structure and function of potassium channels or prevent the channels from being inserted correctly into the cell membrane. Many mutations prevent a molecule called PIP2 from binding to the channels and effectively regulating their activity. These changes disrupt the flow of potassium ions in skeletal and cardiac muscle, leading to the periodic paralysis and irregular heart rhythm characteristic of Andersen–Tawil syndrome.Researchers have not yet determined the role of the KCNJ2 gene in bone development, and it is not known how mutations in the gene lead to the developmental abnormalities often found in Andersen–Tawil syndrome.High dose of K+ has been used with different results.It is named for Ellen Andersen[4] and Al-Rabi Tawil.[5][6]M: HRTanat/phys/devpnoco/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (C1A/1B/1C/1D), blte"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:42 UTC +00:00]]

The sister syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, is caused by a similar loss of paternally inherited genes and maternal imprinting. AS is named after a British pediatrician, Dr. Harry Angelman, who first described the syndrome in 1965.[1] An older, alternative term for AS, \"happy puppet syndrome\", is generally considered pejorative and stigmatizing so it is no longer the accepted term, though it is sometimes still used as an informal term of diagnosis.[citation needed] People with AS are sometimes known as \"angels\", both because of the syndrome's name and because of their youthful, happy appearance.The following text lists signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome and their relative frequency in affected individuals.[2]Consistent (100%)Frequent (more than 80%)Associated (20–80%)Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of the normal maternal contribution to a region of chromosome 15, most commonly by deletion of a segment of that chromosome. Other causes include uniparental disomy, translocation, or single gene mutation in that region. A healthy person receives two copies of chromosome 15, one from the mother, the other from the father. However, in the region of the chromosome that is critical for Angelman syndrome, the maternal and paternal contribution express certain genes very differently. This is due to sex-specific epigenetic imprinting; the biochemical mechanism is DNA methylation. In a normal individual, the maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is specifically silenced in the developing brain. If the maternal contribution is lost or mutated, the result is Angelman syndrome. (When the paternal contribution is lost, by similar mechanisms, the result is Prader-Willi syndrome.) It should be noted that the methylation test that is performed for Angelman syndrome (a defect in UBE3A) is actually looking for methylation on the gene's neighbor SNRPN (which is silenced by methylation on the maternal copy of the gene).[3]Angelman syndrome can also be the result of mutation of a single gene. This gene (UBE3A,[4] part of the ubiquitin pathway) is present on both the maternal and paternal chromosomes, but differs in the pattern of methylation (imprinting). The paternal silencing of the UBE3A gene occurs in a brain region-specific manner; in the hippocampus and cerebellum, the maternal allele is almost exclusively the active one. The most common genetic defect leading to Angelman syndrome is an ~4Mb (mega base) maternal deletion in chromosomal region 15q11-13 causing an absence of UBE3A expression in the paternally imprinted brain regions. UBE3A codes for an E6-AP ubiquitin ligase, which chooses its substrates very selectively, and the four identified E6-AP substrates have shed little light on the possible molecular mechanisms underlying Angelman syndrome in humans.Initial studies of mice that do not express maternal UBE3A show severe impairments in hippocampal memory formation. Most notably, there is a deficit in a learning paradigm that involves hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning. In addition, maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area CA1 in vitro is disrupted in Ube3a-/- mice. These results provide links amongst hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vitro, formation of hippocampus-dependent memory in vivo, and the molecular pathology of Angelman syndrome.One of the more notable features of Angelman Syndrome (AS) is the syndrome’s pathognomonic neurophysiological findings. The electroencephalogram (EEG) in AS is usually very abnormal, and more abnormal than clinically expected.[5] Three distinct interictal patterns are seen in these patients.[6] The most common pattern is a very large amplitude 2–3 Hz rhythm most prominent in prefrontal leads. Next most common is a symmetrical 4–6 Hz high voltage rhythm. The third pattern, 3–6 Hz activity punctuated by spikes and sharp waves in occipital leads, is associated with eye closure. Paroxysms of laughter have no relation to the EEG, ruling out this feature as a gelastic phenomenon.[5]It appears that the neurons of patients with Angelman syndrome are formed correctly, but they cannot function properly.[citation needed]The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome is based on:Diagnostic criteria for the disorder were initially established in 1995 in collaboration with the Angelman syndrome Foundation (USA);[7] these criteria have undergone revision in 2005.[8]There is currently no cure available. The epilepsy can be controlled by the use of one or more types of anticonvulsant medications. However, there are difficulties in ascertaining the levels and types of anticonvulsant medications needed to establish control, because AS is usually associated with having multiple varieties of seizures, rather than just the one as in normal cases of epilepsy. Many families use melatonin to promote sleep in a condition which often affects sleep patterns. Many individuals with Angelman syndrome sleep for a maximum of 5 hours at any one time. Mild laxatives are also used frequently to encourage regular bowel movements, and early intervention with physiotherapy is important to encourage joint mobility and prevent stiffening of the joints.Those with the syndrome are generally happy and contented people who like human contact and play. People with AS exhibit a profound desire for personal interaction with others. Communication can be difficult at first, but as a child with AS develops, there is a definite character and ability to make themselves understood. People with AS tend to develop strong non-verbal skills to compensate for their limited use of speech. It is widely accepted that their understanding of communication directed to them is much larger than their ability to return conversation. Most afflicted people will not develop more than 5–10 words, if any at all.[9]Seizures are a consequence, but so is excessive laughter,[10] which is a major hindrance to early diagnosis.The severity of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome varies significantly across the population of those affected. Some speech and a greater degree of self-care are possible among the least profoundly affected. Unfortunately, walking and the use of simple sign language may be beyond the reach of the more profoundly affected. Early and continued participation in physical, occupational (related to the development of fine-motor control skills), and communication (speech) therapies are believed to improve significantly the prognosis (in the areas of cognition and communication) of individuals affected by AS. Further, the specific genetic mechanism underlying the condition is thought to correlate to the general prognosis of the affected person. On one end of the spectrum, a mutation to the UBE3A gene is thought to correlate to the least affected, whereas larger deletions on chromosome 15 are thought to correspond to the most affected.The clinical features of Angelman syndrome alter with age. As adulthood approaches, hyperactivity and poor sleep patterns improve. The seizures decrease in frequency and often cease altogether and the EEG abnormalities are less obvious. Medication is typically advisable to those with seizure disorders. Often overlooked is the contribution of the poor sleep patterns to the frequency and/or severity of the seizures. Medication may be worthwhile to help deal with this issue and improve the prognosis with respect to seizures and sleep. Also noteworthy are the reports that the frequency and severity of seizures temporarily escalate in pubescent Angelman syndrome girls, but do not seem to affect long-term health.The facial features remain recognizable with age, but many adults with AS look remarkably youthful for their age.Puberty and menstruation begin at around the average age. Sexual development is thought to be unaffected, as evidenced by a single reported case of a woman with Angelman syndrome conceiving a female child who also had Angelman syndrome.[11]The majority of those with AS achieve continence by day and some by night. Angelman syndrome is not a degenerative syndrome. Many people with AS improve their living skills with support.Dressing skills are variable and usually limited to items of clothing without buttons or zippers. Most adults can eat with a knife or spoon and fork, and can learn to perform simple household tasks. General health is fairly good and life-span near average. Particular problems which have arisen in adults are a tendency to obesity (more in females), and worsening of scoliosis[12] if it is present. The affectionate nature which is also a positive aspect in the younger children may also persist into adult life where it can pose a problem socially, but this problem is not insurmountable.Harry Angelman, a pediatrician working in Warrington, England, first reported three children with this condition in 1965.[1] Angelman later described his choice of the title \"Puppet Children\" to describe these cases as being related to an oil painting he had seen while vacationing in Italy:The history of medicine is full of interesting stories about the discovery of illnesses. The saga of Angelman's syndrome is one such story. It was purely by chance that nearly thirty years ago (e.g., circa 1964) three handicapped children were admitted at various times to my children's ward in England. They had a variety of disabilities and although at first sight they seemed to be suffering from different conditions I felt that there was a common cause for their illness. The diagnosis was purely a clinical one because in spite of technical investigations which today are more refined I was unable to establish scientific proof that the three children all had the same handicap. In view of this I hesitated to write about them in the medical journals. However, when on holiday in Italy I happened to see an oil painting in the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona called . . . a Boy with a Puppet. The boy's laughing face and the fact that my patients exhibited jerky movements gave me the idea of writing an article about the three children with a title of Puppet Children. It was not a name that pleased all parents but it served as a means of combining the three little patients into a single group. Later the name was changed to Angelman syndrome. This article was published in 1965 and after some initial interest lay almost forgotten until the early eighties.Case reports from the United States first began appearing in the medical literature in the early 1980s.[14][15] In 1987, it was first noted that around half of the children with AS have a small piece of chromosome 15 missing (chromosome 15q partial deletion).[16]Though the prevalence of Angelman syndrome is not precisely known, there are some estimates. The best data available are from studies of school age children, ages 6–13 years, living in Sweden and from Denmark where the diagnosis of AS children in medical clinics was compared to an 8-year period of about 45,000 births. The Swedish study showed an AS prevalence of about 1/20,000[17] and the Danish study showed a minimum AS prevalence of about 1/10,000.[18]Two researchers are working on therapeutic treatments for Angelman Syndrome: Dr Edwin Weeber is seeking to begin human clinical trials in 2012 [19] and Dr Ben Philpot's research is showing promise in the mouse model.[20] Each are seeking to test compounds that have been previously approved for use in humans, but not as a therapeutic treatment for Angelman Syndrome.In the 2011 Philippine drama series Budoy, the titular character and main protagonist Budoy Maniego (played by Filipino actor Gerald Anderson) is diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome.Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome ♀ / Silver–Russell syndrome ♂"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:42 UTC +00:00]]

Other supporting features may include fever, Raynaud's phenomenon and \"mechanics hands\"-thick, cracked skin usuall on the palms and radial surfaces of the digits.[3]The disease, rare as it is, is more prevalent in women than in men. Early diagnosis is difficult, and milder cases may not be detected. Also, interstitial lung disease may be the only manifestation of the disease. Severe disease may develop over time, with intermittent relapses.[4]It is postulated that autoantigens are formed against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The synthethases may be involved in recruiting antigen-presenting and inflammatory cells to the site of muscle or lung injury. The specific molecular pathway of the process awaits elucidation.[4]The most common antibody is \"Anti-Jo-1\" named after the John P, a patient with polymyositis and interstitial lung disease detected in 1980.[5] This antibody is commonly seen in patients with pulmonary manifestations of the syndrome. Other possible antibodies include: -Anti-PL-7 -Anti-PL-12 -Anti-EJ -Anti-OJ -Anti-KS -Anti-Zo -Anti-Ha-YRS -Anti-SRP [6]In the presence of suspicious symptoms a number of test are helpful in the diagnosis:[4]In certain situations, testing of other antibodies, specific imaging (MRI, thoracic high resolution computed tomography), and swallowing evaluation may be needed.Unfortunately, treatment for the anti-synthetase syndrome is limited, and usually involves immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids. For patients with pulmonary involvement, the most serious complication of this syndrome is pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.Additional immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary and include azathioprine and/or methotrexate.[4]Prognosis is largely determined by the extent of pulmonary involvement and its progression."], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:42 UTC +00:00]]

It is classified as a branchial arch syndrome, affecting the first branchial (or pharyngeal) arch, the precursor of the maxilla and mandible. Disturbances in the development of the branchial arches in fetal development create lasting and widespread effects.In 1906, Eugène Apert, a French physician, described nine people sharing similar attributes and characteristics.[1] Linguistically, \"acro\" is Greek for \"peak\", referring to the \"peaked\" head that is common in the syndrome. \"Cephalo\", also from Greek, is a combining form meaning \"head\". \"Syndactyly\" refers to webbing of fingers and toes.In embryology, the hands and feet have selective cells that die, called selective cell death or apoptosis, causing separation of the digits. In the case of acrocephalosyndactyly, selective cell death does not occur and skin, and rarely bone, between the fingers and toes fuses.The cranial bones are affected as well, similar to Crouzon syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome. Craniosynostosis occurs when the fetal skull and facial bones fuse too soon in utero, disrupting normal bone growth. Fusion of different sutures leads to different patterns of growth on the skull. Examples include: trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic suture), brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal suture and lambdoid suture bilaterally), dolichocephaly (fusion of the sagittal suture), plagiocephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures unilaterally), and oxycephaly or turricephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoid sutures).Findings for the incidence of the syndrome in the population have varied,[2] with estimates as low as 1 birth in 200,000 provided[3] and 160,000 given as an average by older studies.[4][5] A study conducted in 1997, however, by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, found an incidence rate of 1 in 80,645 out of almost 2.5 million live births.[6] Another study conducted in 2002 by the Craniofacial Center, North Texas Hospital For Children, found a higher incidence of about 1 in 65,000 live births.[2]The cranial malformations are the most apparent effects of acrocephalosyndactyly. Craniosynostosis occurs, with brachiocephaly being the common pattern of growth. Another common characteristic is a high, prominent forehead with a flat posterior skull. Due to the premature closing of the coronal sutures, increased cranial pressure can develop, leading to mental deficiency. A flat or concave face may develop as a result of deficient growth in the mid-facial bones, leading to a conditir prognathism. Other features of acrocephalosyndactyly may include shallow bony orbits and broadly spaced eyes. Low-set ears are also a typical characteristic of branchial arch syndromes.All acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes show some level of limb anomalies, so it can be hard to tell them apart. However, the typical hand deformities in patients with Apert Syndrome distinguish it from the other syndromes.[7] The hands in patients with Apert syndrome always show four common features:[8]The deformity of the space between the index finger and the thumb may be variable. Based on this first webspace, we can differentiate three different types of handdeformation:Acrocephalosyndactyly may be an autosomal dominant disorder. Males and females are affected equally; however research is yet to determine an exact cause. Nonetheless, almost all cases are sporadic, signifying fresh mutations or environmental insult to the genome. The offspring of a parent with Apert syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. In 1995, A.O.M. Wilkie published a paper showing evidence that acrocephalosyndactyly is caused by a defect on the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene, on chromosome 10.[9]Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder; approximately two-thirds of the cases are due to a C to G mutation at the position 755 in the FGFR2 gene, which causes a Ser to Trp change in the protein.[10] This is a male-specific mutation hotspot: in a study of 57 cases, the mutation always occurred on the paternally derived allele.[11] On the basis of the observed birth prevalence of the disease (1 in 70,000), the apparent rate of C to G mutations at this site is about .00005, which is 200- to 800-fold higher than the usual rate for mutations at CG dinucleotides. Moreover, the incidence rises sharply with the age of the father. Goriely et al. (2003) analyzed the allelic distribution of mutations in sperm samples from men of different ages and concluded that the simplest explanation for the data is that the C to G mutation gives the cell an advantage in the male germline.[10]It is still not very clear why people with Apert Syndrome have both craniosynostosis and syndactyly. There has been one study that suggests it has something to do with the expression of three isoforms of FGFR2, the gene with the point mutations that causes the syndrome in 98% of the patients.[12] KFGR, keratinocyte growth factor receptor, is an isoform active in the metaphysis and interphalangeal joints. FGFR1 is an isoform active in the diaphysis. FGFR2-Bek is active in the metaphysis, as well as the diaphysis, but also in the interdigital mesenchyme. The point mutation increases the ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2, and thus of its isoforms. This means that FGFR2 loses its specificity, causing binding of FGFs that normally do not bind to the receptor. Since FGF suppresses apoptosis, the interdigital mesenchyme is maintained. FGF also increases replication and differentiation of osteoblasts, thus early fusion of several sutures of the skull. This may explain why both symptoms are always found in Apert Syndrome.Surgery is needed to prevent the closing of the coronal sutures from damaging brain development. In particular, surgeries for the LeFort III or monobloc midface distraction osteogenesis which detaches the midface or the entire upper face, respectively, from the rest of the skull, are performed in order to reposition them in the correct plane. These surgeries are performed by both plastic and oral and maxillofacial (OMS) surgeons, often in collaboration.There is no standard treatment for the hand malformations in Apert due to the differences and severity in clinical manifestations in different patients. Every patient should therefore be individually approached and treated, aiming at an adequate balance between hand functionality and aesthetics. However, some guidelines can be given depending on the severity of the deformities. In general it is initially recommended to release the first and fourth interdigital spaces, thus releasing the border rays.[13] This makes it possible for the child to grasp things with its hand, a very important function for the child's development. Later the second and third interdigital spaces have to be released. Because there are three handtypes in Apert, all with their own deformities, they all need a different approach regarding their treatment:With growing of a child and respectively the hands, secondary revisions are needed to treat the contractures and to improve the aesthetics.Common relevant features of acrocephalosyndactyly are a high-arched palate, pseudomandibular prognathism (appearing as mandibular prognathism), a narrow palate, and crowding of the teeth.EDAR (EDAR Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:43 UTC +00:00]]

Neither condition has been shown to have a higher frequency in Jews or Muslims.[citation needed]The Midrash of Ki-Tetze [כי תצא] notes that Moses was born aposthic. Other sources tell us that Jacob, his son Gad and King David were also born aposthic. Jewish law requires males born without a foreskin or who lost their foreskin through means other than a formal circumcision ceremony (brit milah ברית מילה) to have a drop of blood (hatafat-dam, הטפת דם) let from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been (or was) attached. The Talmud (Shabbat 135A) records a discussion of whether the importance of this letting of blood supersedes Shabbat, on which only a boy who was born the previous Shabbat can be circumcised. If a regular circumcision is delayed, there is no disagreement that this may not be performed on Shabbat. However, in the case of aposthia, there are two schools of thought.David Levy, former Israeli Foreign Minister and member of Knesset, was born aposthic. Arye Avneri's authorized 1983 biography of Levy notes this:The rabbis in Rabat proclaimed that this foretold that Levy would grow up to be a \"leader of Israel\", even though the State was not founded until Levy was 11, in 1948. This proclamation was not necessarily prophetic of the founding of Israel, for \"Israel\" is a term that is universally used to refer to \"the Jewish people.\"Some traditions in Islam say Muhammed was born without a foreskin.[3]Lazarus Long, principal protagonist in several of Robert Heinlein's novels, was born aposthic.[4]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:43 UTC +00:00]]

The condition responds to glucocorticoid treatment. It results from mutations in the HSD11B2 gene, which encodes the kidney isozyme of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. In an unaffected individual, this isozyme inactivates circulating cortisol to the less-active metabolite cortisone. The inactivating mutation leads to elevated local concentrations of cortisol in the kidney. Cortisol at high concentrations can cross-react and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to aldosterone-like effects in the kidney. This is what causes the hypokalemia, hypertension, and hypernatremia associated with the syndrome.Other conditions such as Liddle's Syndrome can mimic the clinical features of AME, so diagnosis can be made by calculating the ratio of free urinary cortisol to free urinary cortisone. Since AME patients create less cortisone, the ratio will much be higher than non-affected patients.[2] Alternatively, one could differentiate between the two syndromes by administering a potassium-sparing diuretic. Patients with Liddle's syndrome will only respond to a diuretic that binds the ENaC channel, whereas those with AME will respond to a diuretic that binds to ENaC or the mineralcorticoid receptor.AME is exceedingly rare, with less than 100 cases recorded worldwide.[2]Liquorice consumption may also cause a temporary form of AME due to its ability to block 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, in turn causing increased levels of cortisol.[3] Cessation of licorice consumption will reverse this form of AME.AME is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1] This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder.

Argininosuccinic aciduria may become evident in the first few days of life because of high blood ammonia, or later in life presenting with \"sparse\" or \"brittle\" hair, developmental delay, and tremors.An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may seem lethargic or be unwilling to eat, have poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature, experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and mental retardation. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen. Immediate treatment and lifelong management (following a strict diet and using appropriate supplements) may prevent many of these complications.Occasionally, an individual may inherit a mild form of the disorder in which ammonia accumulates in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress.Argininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 live births. Many patients can now be detected on the newborn screen if their blood citrulline is elevated.Mutations in the ASL gene cause argininosuccinic aciduria. Argininosuccinic aciduria belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions in the cells of the liver. It processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys.In argininosuccinic aciduria, the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, involved in the conversion of arginino succinate to arginine within the urea cycle, is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia.Ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so argininosuccinic aciduria causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver.This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.

It affects both sexes, manifesting itself in males as marked or complete phenotypical feminization (with the exception of the genitalia; i.e., no pseudohermaphroditism), in whom it fits the definition of a form of intersex, and in females as hyperfeminization.[1][2][3]To date, 10 families with AES have been fully described in the medical literature, of which 23 males and at least 6 females were characterized as displaying symptoms of the condition.[1][4]The root cause of AES is not entirely clear, but it has been elucidated that inheritable, autosomal dominant genetic mutations affecting CYP19A1, the gene which encodes aromatase, are involved in its etiology.[1][3][4]Observed physiological abnormalities of the condition include a dramatic overexpression of aromatase and, accordingly, excessive levels of estrogens including estradiol and estrone,[5] and a very high rate of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. In one study, cellular aromatase mRNA expression was found to be at least 10 times higher in a female patient compared to the control, and the estradiol/testosterone ratio after an injection of testosterone in a male patient was found to be 100 times greater than the control.[1] Additionally, in another study, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were found to be either low or normal in males, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were very low (likely due to suppression by estrogen, which has antigonadotropic effects as a form of negative feedback inhibition on sex steroid production in sufficiently high amounts),[6] whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were normal.[4]The symptoms of AES, in males, include heterosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-inappropriate secondary sexual characteristics; i.e., a fully or mostly feminized appearance), severe prepubertal or peripubertal gynecomastia (development of breasts in males before or around puberty), hypogonadism (dysfunctional gonads), oligozoospermia (low sperm count), small testes, micropenis (an ususually small penis), advanced bone maturation, an earlier peak height velocity (an accelerated rate of growth in regards to height),[7] and short final stature due to early epiphyseal closure, and in females, isosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-appropriate secondary sexual characteristics), macromastia (excessively large breasts), an enlarged uterus, menstrual irregularities, and, similarly to males, accelerated bone maturation and short final height. Fertility, though usually affected to one degree or another—especially in males—is not always impaired significantly enough to prevent sexual reproduction, as evidenced by vertical transmission of the condition by both sexes.[1][2][3]Individuals with AES may be at higher risk of developing estrogen-sensitive cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.[8][9] At least one patient, a male with the condition, was reported as having developed carcinoma of the breast.[1]Several treatments have been found to be effective in managing AES, including aromatase inhibitors and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in both sexes, androgen replacement therapy with non-aromatizable androgens such as DHT in males, and progestogens (which, by virtue of their antigonadotropic properties at high doses, suppress estrogen levels) in females. In addition, male patients often seek bilateral mastectomy, whereas females may opt for breast reduction if warranted.[1][2][3]Medical treatment of AES is not absolutely necessary, but it is recommended as the condition, if left untreated, can lead to excessively large breasts (which may necessitate surgical reduction), problems with fertility, and possibly an increased risk of estrogen-dependent cancers later in life.[1]M: ENDanat/phys/devp/hormnoco (d)/cong/tumr, sysi/eponproc, drug (A10/H1/H2/H3/H5)1.2: Feingold syndrome ·  Saethre–Chotzen syndrome2.1 (Intracellular receptor): Thyroid hormone resistance ·  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS, MAIS, CAIS) ·  Kennedy's disease ·  PHA1AD pseudohypoaldosteronism ·  Estrogen insensitivity syndrome ·  X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita ·  MODY 1 ·  Familial partial lipodystrophy 3 ·  SF1 XY gonadal dysgenesis2.2: Barakat syndrome ·  Tricho–rhino–phalangeal syndrome2.3: Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome/Pallister–Hall syndrome ·  Denys–Drash syndrome ·  Duane-radial ray syndrome ·  MODY 7 ·  MRX 89 ·  Townes–Brocks syndrome ·  Acrocallosal syndrome ·  Myotonic dystrophy 23.1: ARX (Ohtahara syndrome, Lissencephaly X2) ·  HLXB9 (Currarino syndrome) ·  HOXD13 (SPD1 Synpolydactyly) ·  IPF1 (MODY 4) ·  LMX1B (Nail–patella syndrome) ·  MSX1 (Tooth and nail syndrome, OFC5) ·  PITX2 (Axenfeld syndrome 1) ·  POU4F3 (DFNA15) ·  POU3F4 (DFNX2) ·  ZEB1 (Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy 3, Fuchs' dystrophy 3) ·  ZEB2 (Mowat–Wilson syndrome)3.2: PAX2 (Papillorenal syndrome) ·  PAX3 (Waardenburg syndrome 1&3) ·  PAX4 (MODY 9) ·  PAX6 (Gillespie syndrome, Coloboma of optic nerve) ·  PAX8 (Congenital hypothyroidism 2) ·  PAX9 (STHAG3)3.3: FOXC1 (Axenfeld syndrome 3, Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type) ·  FOXC2 (Lymphedema–distichiasis syndrome) ·  FOXE1 (Bamforth–Lazarus syndrome) ·  FOXE3 (Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis) ·  FOXF1 (ACD/MPV) ·  FOXI1 (Enlarged vestibular aqueduct) ·  FOXL2 (Premature ovarian failure 3) ·  FOXP3 (IPEX)4.2: Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome4.3: Holt–Oram syndrome ·  Li–Fraumeni syndrome ·  Ulnar–mammary syndrome4.7: Campomelic dysplasia ·  MODY 3 ·  MODY 5 ·  SF1 (SRY XY gonadal dysgenesis, Premature ovarian failure 7) ·  SOX10 (Waardenburg syndrome 4c, Yemenite deaf-blind hypopigmentation syndrome)Coactivator: CREBBP (Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome)M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)M: ENDanat/phys/devp/hormnoco (d)/cong/tumr, sysi/eponproc, drug (A10/H1/H2/H3/H5)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:43 UTC +00:00]]

It derives its name from Greek, literally meaning \"curving of joints\" (arthron, \"joint\"; grȳpōsis, late Latin form of late Greek grūpōsis, \"hooking\").[1] Children born with one or more joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to do passive extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints.[2] AMC has been divided into three groups: amyoplasia, distal arthrogryposis and syndromic. Amyoplasia is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness.[3] Distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet. Types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group.[3]Arthrogryposis is a rare condition. Some authors say the overall prevalence is one in 3000[3] and others say it is one in 11000-12000 among European live births.[4] Congenital clubfoot is the most common single contracture and its prevalence is one in 500 live births.[3]Some of the different types of AMC include:Almost every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is affected, because in 84% all limbs are involved, in 11% only the legs and in 4% only the arms are involved.[39] Every joint in the body has typical signs and symptoms like the shoulder (internal rotation), wrist (volar and ulnar), hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm), hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, frequently dislocated), elbow (extension and pronation) and foot (clubfoot).[2] The range of motion capability can be different between joints because of the different deviations.[40] Some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical joint/limb involvement, with normal sensations.[39][40] The contractures in the joints are sometimes resulting in a reduced walking development in the first 5 years.[40] The intelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia.[39] But it is unknown how many of these children have an above normal intelligent and there is no literature available about the cause of this symptom. There are a few syndromes like the Freeman-Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement.[39] The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.[39] Arthrogryposis is a not a diagnosis but a clinical finding. So this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases. These other diagnosis can be found in every single organ in a patient. There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects, tracheoesophageal fistulas, inguinal hernias, cleft palate, and eye abnormalities.[41]Research of arthrogryposis has shown that anything that inhibits normal joint movement before birth can result in joint contractures.[3] Arthrogryposis could be caused by genetic and environmental factors. In principle: any factor that entails fetal movement of the fetus can result to congenital contractures.[39] The exact causes of arthrogryposis are unknown yet.The malformations of arthrogryposis can be secondary to environmental factors such as: decreased intrauterine movement, few fluid water, oligohydramnios, and defects in the fetal blood supply. Other causes could be: hyperthermia, limb immobilization and viral infections. Myasthenia gravis of the mother leads also in rare cases to arthrogryposis. The major cause in humans is fetal akinesia.[2] However, this is disputed lately.[2]Arthrogryposis could also be caused by intrinsic factors. Think of molecular, muscle- and connective tissues development disorders or neurological abnormalities.Research has shown that there are more than 35 specific genetic disorders associated with arthrogryposis. Most of those mutations are missense, which means the mutation results in a different amino acid. Other mutations that could cause arthrogryposis are: single gene defects (X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant), mitochondrial defects and chromosomal disorders (for example: trisomy 18).[39] This is mostly seen in distal arthrogryposis. Mutations in at least five genes (TNN12, TNNT3, TPM2, MYH3 and MYH8) could cause distal arthrogryposis.[3] There could be also connective tissue-, neurological of muscle development disorders.[3]Loss of muscle mass with an imbalance of muscle power at the joint can lead to connective tissue abnormality.[2] This leads to joint fixation and reduced fetal movement.[2] Also muscle abnormalities could lead to reduce of fetal movement. Those could be: dystrophy, myopathy and mitochondrial disorders. This is mostly the result of abnormal function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-associated complex in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles.[2]In 70-80% of the cases of arthrogryposis are caused by neurological abnormalities. Most of these are underlying of a genetic syndrome or the result of environmental factors.[3]The underlying aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital contractures, particularly arthrogryposis and the mechanism of the mutations remains an active area of investigation. Because identifying these factors could help to develop treatment and congenital finding of arthrogryposis.[3][42]There is currently a lot of research on prenatal diagnosis. The diagnosis can be made prenatally in approximately 50% of fetuses presenting arthrogryposis.[43] It could be found during routine ultrasound scanning showing a lack of mobility and abnormal position of the foetus.[2] Nowadays there are more options for visualization of details and structures can be seen well, like the use of 4D ultrasound.[2] In clinic a child can be diagnosed with arthrogryposis with physical examination, confirmed by ultrasound, MRI,[3][43] or muscle biopsy.[43]The treatment of arthrogryposis includes occupational therapy, splinting and surgery.[3] The primary long-term goals of these treatments are increasing joint mobility, muscle strength and the development of adaptive use patterns that allow for walking and independence with activities of daily living. Since arthrogryposis includes many different types, the treatment varies between patients depending on the symptoms.[3] Only a few good articles exist in which a surgical technique that is used to treat arthrogryposis is described. These surgeries are explained below.Children with the amyoplasia type of arthrogryposis usually have flexed and ulnarly deviated wrists.[2] Dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy is indicated for wrists with excessive flexion contracture deformity when non-surgical interventions such as occupational therapy and splinting have failed to improve function. On the dorsal side, at the level of the midcarpus, a wedge osteotomy is made. Sufficient bone is resected to at least be able to put the wrist in a neutral position. If the wrist is also ulnarly deviated, more bone can be taken from the radial side to correct this abnormality. This position is held into place with two cross K-wires. In addition, a tendon transfer of the extensor carpi ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis may be performed to correct ulnar deviation or wrist extension weakness, or both. This tendon transfer is only used if the extensor carpi ulnaris appears to be functional enough.[44]The soft tissue envelope in congenital contractual conditions such as clasped or arthrogrypotic thumbs is often deficient in two planes, the thumb-index web and the flexor aspect of the thumb. There is often an appearance of increased skin at the base of the index finger that is part of the deformity. This tissue can be used to resurface the thumb-index web after a comprehensive release of all the tight structures to allow for a larger range of motion of the thumb. This technique is called the index rotation flap. The flap is taken from the radial side of the index finger. It is proximally based at the distal edge of the thumb-index web. The flap is made as wide as possible, but still small enough to close with the excessive skin on the palmar side of the index finger. The flap is rotated around the tightest part of the thumb to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, allowing for a larger range of motion.[45]Many other surgeries are also able to improve function in joints of arthrogryposis patients. These surgeries usually exist out of tendon transfers and skin flap movements, adjusted to the individual.There is still little literature available about the prognosis of patient with arthrogryposis. The search for a prognostic factor is difficult, because of the small number of patients. But there are a few factors that seem to have an influence on the prognosis like the progressive muscle activity improvement. Results of a study showed an increase in strength during growth after the recovery of a passive range of motion in a useful arc.[40] Other positive prognostic factors for independent walking were active hips and knees, hip flexion contractures of less than 20 degrees and knee flexion contractures less than 15 degrees without severe scoliosis.[40]M: JNTanat (h/c, u, t, l)/physnoco (arth/defr/back/soft)/cong, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M01C, M4)M: JNTanat (h/c, u, t, l)/physnoco (arth/defr/back/soft)/cong, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M01C, M4)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:43 UTC +00:00]]

WHERE "diseases"."id" = 54  [["page_content", "Aspartylglucosaminuria ( commonly referred to as AGU) is an inherited disease that is characterized by a decline in mental functioning, accompanied by an increase in skin bone and joint issues. This disease is caused by a defect in an enzyme known as aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme plays a significant role in our body because it aids in breaking down certain sugars ( for example oligosaccharides) that are attached to specific proteins ( for example: glycoproteins). Aspartylglucosaminuria itself is characterized as a lysosomal disease because it does deal with inadequate activity in an enzymes function.[1] Aspartylglucosaminidase function is to break down glycoproteins. These proteins are most abundant in the tissues of the body and in the surfaces of major organs, such as: the liver, spleen, thyroid and nerves. When glycoproteins are unable to be broken down then it causes aspartylglucosaminidase to back up in the lysosomes along with other substances. This back up causes damage to the tissues and organs that is progressive.[2]At birth, there is no signs that a child will develop symptoms of Aspartylglucosaminuria. Typically, signs and symptoms become apparent between two and four years of age and become progressively worse as the individual gets older. The signs and symptoms an individual may see are as follows-[2] 　(Children are physically uncoordinated, but remain able to play sports and do everyday activities until they reach adulthood)This disease isn’t contagious therefore you cannot not catch aspartylglucosaminuria. It is a genetic condition that must be inherited from both parents. You are born with two copies of the gene AGU. One copy comes from the mother’s egg and the other copy comes from the father’s sperm.[1] In order to develop aspartylglucosaminuria, the individual must inherit changes in both of their AGU genes (autonomic recessive inheritance). If a child has aspartylglucosaminuria, their child received a changed copy of the AGU from both parents. When a person receives one changed form of the gene AGU from one of the parents, the individual is then classified as a carrier.[4][5]In order to be diagnosed with AGU an individual needs to take a urine test, which will show indication of an increased amount of aspartylglucosamin being secreted. The confirmation of the diagnosis of aspartylglucosaminuria requires the individual to take a blood test. The blood test helps show if the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase is present or partially absent. A skin simple taken from the individual also will show the amount of aspartylglucosaminidase present.[3]When families have a child that has already been diagnosed with AGU, they have the option to observe the enzymes activity that codes for AGU in future pregnancy to help determine if the next child will also have a positive diagnosis for aspartylglucosaminuria.[1]No treatment is available to cure or slow down the progression of aspartylglucosaminuria. Attempts to replace the missing enzyme by a bone marrow transplant have been conducted in hope that the bone marrow will produce the missing enzyme. The results to the tests thus far have shown to be inconclusive.[1]à Since ear infections and respiratory infections are common for children diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria, it is best to have regular check ups for both the ears and the respiratory tract. à Extreme sensitivity to the sun’s rays may develop and the best way to protect an individual diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria is to have them wear sunglasses, hats or caps to protect their eyes. à Epilepsy and insomnia can both be treated with medication. à It will be most beneficial to children who are diagnosed with AGU to have receive an education from a school with special teaching.[3]The process of habilitation for individuals diagnosed with AGU needs to be established in their early stages of life. The team for habilitation should include professionals that are experienced in disabilities and the effects that having a disability can have on everyday life. Habilitation will include assessments, assistance with the choice of aids and information concerning disabilities and counseling.[3]Aspartylglucosaminuria is estimated to affect 1 in 18,500 people in Finland. This condition is less common outside of Finland, but the incidence is unknown.[4] Even though this disease can occur in various races and ethnicities, another study made backed this finding up by stating that 1 in 26,000 people in Finland had the disease and that 1 in 18,000 were carriers of aspartylglucosaminuria.[2]After trisomy 21 and fragile X syndrome, this is the most frequent multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome.[6]Individuals with AGU typically have normal development in infancy. Around the age of 2–4 years, they begin showing signs of developmental delay, but development is still progressing. Initial symptoms may present as clumsiness and/or speech delay. Individuals with AGU also show increased upper respiratory infections. Development continues until about puberty, however, individuals at 13–16 years of age typically show mental and motor development similar to a 5-6 year old. Around puberty, a gradual decline in mental abilities and motor skills occurs. This progressive decline continues until about 25–28 years of age, when rapid impairment of abilities occurs, resulting in severe mental retardation.[3]Aspartylglucosaminuria was first reported by Jenner and Pollitt (1967) Pollitt also aided in finding the urinary excretion amounts of 2-acetamido-1-(beta-L-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxyglucose in a 32-year-old female and her 20-year-old brother with mental retardation.An enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing this compound is normally present in seminal fluid but was absent in that of the brother. A generalized lack of this enzyme was postulated. Both sibs had thick sagging skin of the cheeks, a finding not present in normal members of the family. Palo and Mattsson (1970) reported 11 cases in Finland. The parents of 1 patient were first cousins. The Finnish cases showed, in addition to severe mental retardation, sagging cheeks, broad nose and face, short neck, cranial asymmetry, scoliosis, periodic hyperactivity, and vacuolated lymphocytes. Diarrhea and frequent infections were problems in infancy. Aspartylglucosaminuria has also been observed in Finns living in Norway (Borud and Torp, 1976). Gehler(1981) described affected brother and sister in a consanguineous Italian sibship; one of the patients showed angiokeratoma corporis diffusum. Yoshida (1991) and Vargas-Diez et al. (2002) also described the occurrence of angiokeratoma corporis diffusum in 2 Japanese patients and 1 Spanish patient, respectively, with aspartylglucosaminuria.Stevenson et al. (1982) reported this disorder in an 18-year-old American. The family name was Scottish-Irish. The mother was said to have been aged 13 years and the father was unknown—circumstances suggesting incest. Mental retardation, recurrent infections, cardiomyopathy, and emotional lability were features. Hreidarsson et al. (1983) reported a case in an American black and an American white of uncertain parentage. Radiographic changes in the hands were noted: thin epiphyses, broad 'poorly modeled' metacarpals, and peculiarly shaped carpal bones.Isenberg and Sharp (1975) reported the case of a girl of Mexican-Italian extraction living in the U.S. Chitayat et al. (1988) described 3 Puerto Rican brothers, with first-cousin parents, who had AGU. Two of the brothers were monozygotic twins. Macroorchidism became evident in all 3 boys at the time of puberty. This feature had not previously been noted in AGU, although other endocrinologic abnormalities had been described. Yoshida et al. (1991) described the first Japanese patients with AGU—a brother and sister, aged 45 and 41, respectively. Both sibs had mental retardation, coarse facial features, angiokeratoma, and myoclonic seizures. Zlotogora et al. (1997) diagnosed this disorder in 8 patients originating from 3 unrelated families, all Palestinian Arabs from the region of Jerusalem. Gordon et al. (1998) described a Canadian family in which 4 of 12 sibs were affected, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Though apparently normal at birth, their developmental milestones, particularly speech, were slow, and they acquired only a simple vocabulary. There was a progressive coarsening of facial features; 3 had inguinal hernia and recurrent diarrhea; all became severely retarded and by the fourth decade showed evident deterioration of both cognitive and motor skills; and 2 exhibited cyclic behavioral changes. Three of the sibs had died, at 33,39, and 44 years of age.[7]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:44 UTC +00:00]]

This disorder is also characterized by an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), distinctive facial features, an inward- and downward-turning foot (clubfoot), and unusually positioned thumbs (hitchhiker thumbs).The signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis, type 2 are similar to those of another skeletal disorder called diastrophic dysplasia.

Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene disrupt the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly and resulting in the skeletal problems characteristic of atelosteogenesis, type 2.This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited for a child to be born with the disorder.

The iron damage to the heart can lead to heart failure. The anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic (the red blood cells are abnormally small and pale). Atransferrinemia is extremely rare, with only eight cases documented worldwide.[3]Severe microcytic hypochromic anemia, growth retardation and recurrent infections are the first clinical signs of the disease. Iron overload occurs mainly in the liver, heart, pancreas, thyroid, kidney and bone joints, leading to mild to severe symptoms of liver and heart failure, arthropathy and hypothyroidism.

Researchers used the first known case reported in the United States[5] and identified mutations in the TF gene as a probable cause of the disorder.Treatment with infusions of plasma or purified apotransferrin may stabilise or correct the anemia and growth defects.M: NUTcof, enz, metnoco, nuvi, sysi/epon, metdrug (A8/11/12)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:44 UTC +00:00]]

This form of neuralgia is difficult to diagnose, as it is rare and the symptoms overlap with several other disorders.[1] The symptoms can occur in addition to having migraine headache, or can be mistaken for migraine alone, or dental problems such as Temporomandibular joint disorder, musculoskeletal issues, or Hypochondriasis. ATN can have a wide range of symptoms and the pain can fluctuate in intensity from mild aching to a crushing or burning sensation, and also to the extreme pain experienced with the more common trigeminal neuralgia.ATN pain can be described as heavy, aching, stabbing and burning. Some sufferers have a constant migraine-like headache. Others may experience intense pain in one or in all three trigeminal nerve branches, including teeth, ears, sinuses, cheeks, forehead, upper and lower jaws, \"behind\" the eyes, and scalp. In addition, those with ATN may also experience the shocks or stabs found in type 1 TN.Many TN and ATN patients have pain that is \"triggered\" by light touch on shifting trigger zones. ATN pain tends to worsen with talking, smiling, chewing, or in response to sensations such as a cool breeze. The pain from ATN is often continuous, and periods of remission are rare. Both TN and ATN can be bilateral, though the character of pain is usually different on the two sides at any one time.[2]ATN is usually attributed to inflammation or demyelination, with increased sensitivity of the trigeminal nerve. These effects are believed to be caused by dental procedures, infection, demyelinating diseases, or compression of the trigeminal nerve (by an impinging vein or artery, a tumor, or arterio-veinous malformation). An interesting aspect is that this form affects both men and women equally and can occur at any age, unlike typical trigeminal neuralgia, which is seen most commonly in women. Though TN and ATN most often present in the fifth decade, cases have been documented as early as infancy.Both forms of facial neuralgia are relatively rare, with an incidence recently estimated between 12 and 24 new cases per hundred thousand population per year.[3][4]ATN often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for extended periods, leading to a great deal of unexplained pain and anxiety. A National Patient Survey conducted by the US Trigeminal Neuralgia Association in the late 1990s indicated that the average facial neuralgia patient may see six different physicians before receiving a first definitive diagnosis. The first practitioner to see facial neuralgia patients is often a dentist who may lack deep training in facial neurology. Thus ATN may be misdiagnosed as Tempormandibular Joint Disorder.[5]This disorder is regarded by many medical professionals to comprise the most severe form of chronic pain known in medical practice. In some patients, pain may be unresponsive even to opioid drugs at any dose level that leaves the patient conscious. The disorder has thus acquired the unfortunate and possibly inflammatory nickname, \"the suicide disease\".[6]Symptoms of ATN may overlap with a similarly unexplained pain occurring in teeth called atypical odontalgia (literal meaning \"unusual tooth pain\"), with aching, burning, or stabs of pain localized to one or more teeth and adjacent jaw. The pain may seem to shift from one tooth to the next, after root canals or extractions. In desperate efforts to alleviate pain, some patients undergo multiple (but unneeded) root canals or extractions, even in the absence of suggestive X-ray evidence of dental abscess.ATN symptoms may also be similar to those of post-herpetic neuralgia, which causes nerve inflammation when the latent Herpes Zoster virus of a previous case of chicken pox re-emerges in shingles. Fortunately, post-herpetic neuralgia is generally treated with medications which are also effective against ATN.The subject of atypical trigeminal neuralgia is considered problematic even among experts. Some forms of orofacial pain are relatively well defined and easy to recognize while the others seem to represent a diverse group of pain syndromes with considerable overlap, several classification schemes, vague characterization and controversial entities. The term Atypical TN is broad and due to the complexity of the condition, there are considerable issues with defining the condition further. Some medical practitioners no longer make a distinction between facial neuralgia (a nominal condition of inflammation) versus facial neuropathy (direct physical damage to a nerve).Due to the variability and imprecision of their pain symptoms, ATN or Atypical Odontalgia patients may be misdiagnosed with \"Atypical Facial Pain\" or \"hypochondriasis\", both of which are considered problematic by many practitioners.[7] The term \"Atypical Facial Pain\" is sometimes assigned to pain which crosses the mid-line of the face or otherwise does not conform to expected boundaries of nerve distributions or characteristics of validated medical entities. As such, the term is seen to comprise a diagnosis by reduction.As noted in material published by the [US] National Pain Foundation: \"Atypical Facial Pain is a confusing term and should never be used to describe patients with trigeminal neuralgia or trigeminal neuropathic pain. Strictly speaking, AFP is classified as a \"somatiform pain disorder\"; this is a psychological diagnosis that should be confirmed by a skilled pain psychologist. Patients with the diagnosis of AFP have no identifiable underlying physical cause for the pain. The pain is usually constant, described as aching or burning, and often affects both sides of the face (this is almost never the case in patients with trigeminal neuralgia). The pain frequently involves areas of the head, face, and neck that are outside the sensory territories that are supplied by the trigeminal nerve. It is important to correctly identify patients with AFP since the treatment for this is strictly medical. Surgical procedures are not indicated for Atypical Facial Pain.\"[8]The term \"hypochondriasis\" is closely related to \"Somatiform Pain Disorder\" and \"Conversion Disorder\" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association. As of July 2011, this axis of the DSM-IV is undergoing major revision for the DSM-V, with introduction of a new designation \"Complex Somatic Symptom Disorder\". However, it remains to be demonstrated that any of these \"disorders\" can reliably be diagnosed as a medical entity with a discrete and reliable course of therapy.[9][10][11][12]It is possible that there are triggers or aggravating factors that patients need to learn to recognize to help manage their health. Bright lights, sounds, stress, and poor diet are examples of additional stimuli that can contribute to the condition. The pain can cause nausea, so beyond the obvious need to treat the pain, it is important to be sure to try to get adequate rest and nutrition.Depression is frequently co-morbid with neuralgia and neuropathic pain of all sorts, as a result of the negative effects that pain has on one's life. Depression and chronic pain may interact, with chronic pain often predisposing patients to depression, and depression operating to sap energy, disrupt sleep and heighten sensitivity and the sense of suffering. Dealing with depression should thus be considered equally important as finding direct relief from the pain.[13]Treatment of patients believed to have ATN or TN is usually begun with medication. The long-time first drug of choice for facial neuralgia has been Carbamazepine (Tegretol), an anti-seizure agent. Due to the significant side-effects and hazards of this drug, others have recently come into common use as alternatives. These include Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and Gabapentin (Neurontin). A positive patient response to one of these medications might be considered as supporting evidence for the diagnosis, which is otherwise made from medical history and pain presentation. There are no present medical tests to conclusively confirm TN or ATN.If the anti-seizure drugs are found ineffective, the supervising physician may introduce one of the tri-cyclic anti-depressant medications such as Amitriptyline (Elavil) or Nortriptyline (Pamelor), among others. The tri-cyclic antidepressants are known to have dual action against both depression and neuropathic pain. Other drugs which may also be tried, either individually or in combination with an anti-seizure agent, include Baclofen, Lyrica, anti-seizure drugs (to calm nerve endings), muscle relaxants, and opioid drugs such as Percocet or Oxycodone.For some ATN patients, treatment with opioid drugs may represent the only viable medical option which preserves quality of life and personal functioning. Although there is considerable controversy in public policy and practice in this branch of medicine, practice guidelines have long been available and published.[14][15][16]If drug treatment is found to be ineffective or causes disabling side effects for the patient, one of several neurosurgical procedures may be considered. The available procedures are believed to be less effective with Type II (Atypical) Trigeminal Neuralgia than with Type I (Typical or \"classic\") TN. Among present procedures, the most effective and long lasting has been found to be Micro-Vascular Decompression (MVD), which seeks to relieve direct compression of the Trigeminal Nerve by separating and padding blood vessels in the vicinity of the emergence of this nerve from the brain stem, below the cranium.[17] Radio Frequency Rhizotomy has similar outcome statistics, with a different mechanism. Rhizotomy introduces a controlled lesion on the nerve distribution further downstream from the brain stem, to interrupt or moderate nerve response and over-sensitivity. Less effective forms of Rhizotomy include Balloon Compression and Glycerol Rhizotomy. Radiosurgery (Gamma radiation or photon beam) techniques — Gamma Knife or Cyber Knife — require no surgical incision. However initial results and persistence of results are not as good as for MVD or RF Rhizotomy.Choice of a surgical procedure is made by the doctor and patient in consultation, based on the patient's pain presentation and health and the doctor's medical experience. Some neurosurgeons resist the application of MVD or other surgeries to Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia, in light of a wide spread perception that ATN pain is less responsive to these procedures. However, recent papers suggest that in cases where pain initially presents as Type I TN, surgery may be effective even after the pain has evolved into Type II.[18]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:44 UTC +00:00]]

Approximately 50% of people with this disease will develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. Progression to end stage kidney disease usually happens in the 4th to 6th decades of life.[1] Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease occurs worldwide and affects about 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 people.[2][3]Defects in two genes are thought to be responsible for ADPKD. In 85% of patients, ADPKD is caused by mutations in the gene PKD1 on chromosome 16 (TRPP1); in 15% of patients mutations in PKD2 (TRPP2) are causative.[1]Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a distinct disease that also leads to cysts in the kidneys and liver, typically presents in childhood, only affects about 1 in 20,000 people[4] and has different causes and prognosis.Recent studies in fundamental cell biology of cilia and flagella using experimental model organisms such as the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse Mus musculus have shed light on how PKD develops in human patients.[5]All cilia and flagella are constructed and maintained by the process of intraflagellar transport, a cellular function that is also essential for the insertion of proteins at specific sites along cilia and flagella membranes. These inserted membrane proteins can initiate environmental sensing and intracellular signaling pathways. They play a special role in the cilia of renal epithelial cells, and are thought to be critical for normal renal cell development and function and are sorted out and localized to the cilia of renal epithelial cells by the aforementioned intraflagellar transport mechanism. Ciliated epithelial cells line the lumen of the urinary collecting ducts and sense the flow of urine. Failure in flow-sensing signaling results in programmed cell death (apoptosis) of these renal epithelial cells, producing the characteristic multiple cysts of PKD. PKD may result from mutations of signaling and environmental sensing proteins, or failure in intraflagellar transport.[6]Two PKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encode membrane proteins that localize to a non-motile cilium on the renal tube cell. Polycystin-2 encoded by PKD2 gene is a calcium channel that allows extracellular calcium ions to enter the cell. Polycystin-1, encoded by PKD1 gene, is thought to be associated with polycystin-2 protein and regulates polycystin-2's channel activity. The calcium ions are important cellular messengers, which trigger complicated biochemical pathways that lead to quiescence and differentiation. Malfunctions of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 proteins, defects in the assembly of the cilium on the renal tube cell, failures in targeting these two proteins to the cilium, and deregulations of calcium signaling all likely cause the occurrence of PKD.As stated above, defects in two genes are thought to be responsible for ADPKD. In 85% of patients, ADPKD is caused by mutations in the gene PKD1 on chromosome 16 (TRPP1); in 15% of patients mutations in PKD2 (TRPP2) are causative.[1][7]The two hit hypothesis (aka Knudson hypothesis ) is often used to explain the manifestation of polycystic kidney disease later in life even though the mutation is present at birth. This term is borrowed from cancer research stating that both copies of the gene present in the genome have to be \"silenced\" before cancer manifests itself (in Knudson's case the silenced gene was Rb1). In ADPKD the original \"hit\" is congenital (in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes) and the subsequent \"hit\" occurs later in life as the cells grow and divide. The two hit hypothesis as it relates to PKD was originally proposed by Reeders in 1992.[8] Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that ARPKD patients develop disease at birth, and somatic mutations in the \"normal\" copy of PKD1 or PKD2 have been found in cyst-lining epitheliaRecent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the genetypical root cause of the widely varying, phenotypically-observed disorders. Thus, PKD is a ciliopathy. Other known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstrom syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and some forms of retinal degeneration.[9]A definite diagnosis of ADPKD relies on imaging or molecular genetic testing. The sensitivity of testing is nearly 100% for all patients with ADPKD who are age 30 years or older and for younger patients with PKD1 mutations; these criteria are only 67% sensitive for patients with PKD2 mutations who are younger than age 30 years. Large echogenic kidneys without distinct macroscopic cysts in an infant/child at 50% risk for ADPKD are diagnostic. In the absence of a family history of ADPKD, the presence of bilateral renal enlargement and cysts, with or without the presence of hepatic cysts, and the absence of other manifestations suggestive of a different renal cystic disease provide presumptive, but not definite, evidence for the diagnosis.Molecular genetic testing by linkage analysis or direct mutation screening is available clinically; however, genetic heterogeneity is a significant complication to molecular genetic testing. Sometimes a relatively large number of affected family members need to be tested in order to establish which one of the two possible genes is responsible within each family. The large size and complexity of PKD1 and PKD2 genes, as well as marked allelic heterogeneity, present obstacles to molecular testing by direct DNA analysis. In the research setting, mutation detection rates of 50-75% have been obtained for PKD1 and ~75% for PKD2. Clinical testing of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes by direct sequence analysis is now available, with a detection rate for disease-causing mutations of 50-70%.Genetic counseling may be helpful for families at risk for polycystic kidney disease.Although a cure for PKD is not available, treatment can ease the symptoms and prolong life.Despite significant research, prognosis of this disease has changed little over time. It is suggested that avoidance of caffeine may prevent cyst formation. Although not well-proven, treatment of hypertension and a low protein diet may slow progression of the disease.Between PKD1 and PKD2, the former has the worse prognosis.Adult polycystic kidney.M: URIanat/phys/devp/cellnoco/acba/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, urteproc/itvp, drug (G4B), blte, urte"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:45 UTC +00:00]]

Up to 50% of affected neonates die of pulmonary hypoplasia, the result of oligohydramnios from severe intrauterine kidney disease. About 80% of those who survive the neonatal period are still alive after 10 years; however, one-third of them will have developed ESRD. Enlarged kidneys may be detected soon after birth as bilateral abdominal masses. Impaired urinary concentrating ability and metabolic acidosis ensue as tubular function deteriorates. Hypertension often occurs in the first few years of life. Kidney function deteriorates progressively from childhood into early adult life. Longer-term survivors frequently develop portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and hypersplenism from periportal fibrosis.Risk factors for progressive kidney disease include younger age at diagnosis, black race, male gender, presence of polycystin-1 mutation, and hypertension. General presenting symptoms and signs include abdominal discomfort, hematuria, urinary tract infection, incidental discovery of hypertension, abdominal mass, elevated serum creatinine, or cystic kidneys on imaging studies, patients usually have renal pain, and develop renal insufficiency.ARPKD-Specific: The classic presentation for ARPKD is systemic hypertension with progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 15. In atypical presentation, a small number of ARPKD sufferers live to adulthood with some kidney function; but with significant deterioration in liver function.[4] This outcome is postulated to result from expression of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene PKHD1, which is located on chromosome 6p.[5]ADPKD-Specific: ADPKD is associated with pathologies in other body systems, in contrast to ARPKD.[4] In 50% of the cases cysts appear in other abdominal organs in including the liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, seminal vesicles, and ovaries. 10 to 30% have Berry aneurysms in the Circle of Willis cerebral circulation. The most common sites for cysts include the coronary arteries; and abnormalities in cardiac valves, hernias, and diverticuli are all documented.[4]Clinical Course: Approximately 50% of patients with ADPKD have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 60, but those with ADPKD-2 tend to have later onset and slower progression. Hypertension is common, and often precedes renal dysfunction. Abdominal pain and early satiety and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms are common, due to the mass effect of the enlarged kidneys. Cyst rupture or hemorrhage into a cyst may produce acute pain or symptoms and signs of localized peritonitis. Hematuria may result from cyst rupture into the collecting system, or from uric acid or calcium oxalate kidney stones. Nephrolithiasis occurs in about 20% of patients.Urinary tract infection occurs with increased frequency in ADPKD. Infection in a kidney or liver cyst is a particularly serious complication. It is most often due to Gram-negative bacteria, and presents with pain, fever, and chills. Blood cultures are frequently positive, but urine culture may be negative, because infected kidney cysts do not communicate directly with the collecting duct system. Distinguishing between infection and cyst hemorrhage is often a challenge, and the diagnosis relies mainly on clinical and bacteriological findings. Radiological and nuclear imaging studies are generally not helpful.Numerous extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD highlight the systemic nature of the disease, and likely reflect a generalized abnormality in collagen and extracellular matrix. Patients with ADPKD have an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, as compared to the general population. Saccular aneurysms of the anterior cerebral circulation may be detected in up to 10% of asymptomatic patients on MRA screening, but most are small, have a low risk of spontaneous rupture, and do not merit the risk of intervention. In general, hemorrhage tends to occur before the age of 50 years. In patients with a family history of intracranial hemorrhage, those who have survived a previous bleed have aneurysms larger than 10 mm, and have uncontrolled hypertension. Other vascular abnormalities include aortic root and annulus dilatation. Cardiac valvular abnormalities occur in 25% of patients – most commonly mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation. Although most valvular lesions are asymptomatic, some may progress over time, and warrant valve replacement. Abdominal hernia and inguinal hernia also occur with a higher frequency than in the general population.Ultrasonography reveals large, echogenic kidneys. The diagnosis can be made in utero after 24 weeks of gestation in severe cases, but cysts generally become visible only after birth. The absence of renal cysts in either parent on ultrasonography helps to distinguish ARPKD from ADPKD in older patients. The wide range of different mutations and the large size of the gene complicate molecular diagnosis, although prenatal diagnosis is possible by gene linkage to the PKHD1 locus in families with a previous confirmed ARPKD birth.The sensitivity of renal ultrasonography for the detection of ADPKD is 100% for subjects 30 years or older with a positive family history. Diagnostic criteria require two or more cysts in one kidney and at least one cyst in the contralateral kidney in young subjects, but four or more in subjects older than 60 years, because of the increased frequency of benign simple cysts. Most often, the diagnosis is made from a positive family history and imaging studies showing large kidneys with multiple bilateral cysts and possibly liver cysts. Before the age of 30 years, CT scan or T2-weighted MRI is more sensitive for detecting presymptomatic disease because the sensitivity of ultrasound falls to 95% for ADPKD type 1 and <70% for ADPKD type 2. Genetic counseling is essential for those being screened. It is recommended that screening for asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms should be restricted to patients with a personal or family history of intracranial hemorrhage. Intervention should be limited to aneurysms larger than 10 mm. Someone with this disease has a 5% chance of getting brain aneurysms.No specific therapy exists for ARPKD. Improvements in mechanical ventilation, neonatal support, blood pressure management, dialysis, and kidney transplantation have led to survival well into adulthood. Complications of hepatic fibrosis may necessitate liver transplantation. Future therapies may target aberrant cell signaling mechanisms, as in ADPKD.At present, treatment is largely supportive, as there is no single therapy that has been shown to prevent the decline in kidney function. Hypertension control with a target blood pressure of 130/85 or less is recommended. Lower levels have been reported to slow the rate of loss of kidney function. A multidrug approach that includes agents to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system is frequently required. There is no compelling evidence to recommend a low-protein diet, especially in patients with advanced kidney dysfunction where optimizing nutritional status is important. Lipid-soluble antimicrobials, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and quinolone antibiotics that have good tissue permeation, are the preferred therapy for infected kidney cysts. Pain-management occasionally requires cyst drainage by percutaneous aspiration, sclerotherapy with alcohol or, rarely, surgical drainage. Patients with ADPKD appear to have a survival advantage on either peritoneal or hemodialysis compared to patients with other causes of ESRD. Those undergoing kidney transplantation may require bilateral nephrectomy if the kidneys are massively enlarged or have been the site of infected cysts. Post-transplantation survival rates are similar to those of patients with other causes of kidney failure, but patients remain at risk for the extrarenal complications of ADPKD.Studies in animal models of inherited cystic disease have identified promising therapeutic strategies, which are undergoing clinical research, including vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists (such as Tolvaptan), and mTOR inhibitors (such as Sirolimus or Everolimus).M: URIanat/phys/devp/cellnoco/acba/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, urteproc/itvp, drug (G4B), blte, urte"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:45 UTC +00:00]]

It was first described by Amin J. Barakat et al. in 1977.[1]It is a genetic developmental disorder[2] with clinical diversity characterized by hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal disease. Patients usually present with hypocalcaemia, tetany, or afebrile convulsions at any age. Hearing loss is usually bilateral and may range from mild to profound impairment. Renal disease includes nephrotic syndrome, cystic kidney, renal dysplasia, hypoplasia or aplasia, pevicalyceal deformity, vesicoureteral reflux, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria and renal scarring.The defect in the majority of cases has mapped to chromosome 10p (Gene Map Locus: 10pter-p13 or 10p14-p15.1). Haploinsufficiency (deletions) of zinc-finger transcription factor GATA3 or mutations in the GATA3 gene[3] appear to be the underlying cause of this syndrome. It causes the failure in the specification of prosensory domain and subsequently leads to increased cell death in the cochlear duct thus causing deafness.[4] Since the spectrum of phenotypic variation in affected patients is quite large, Barakat (HDR) syndrome probably arises as a low penetrance haploinsufficient disorder in which the patients' genetic background plays a major role in the severity of the disease.Inheritance is probably autosomal dominant.A thorough diagnosis should be performed on every affected individual, and siblings should be studied for deafness, parathyroid and renal disease. The syndrome should be considered in infants who have been diagnosed prenatally with a chromosome 10p defect, and those who have been diagnosed with well defined phenotypes of urinary tract abnormalities.

Analysis of the pooled data revealed that female patients were affected approximately 4 times more often than males. The median age of the onset of lipodystrophy was 7 years. Several autoimmune diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis, were associated with APL. The prevalence rates of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were 6.7% and 8.9%, respectively. Approximately 83% of APL patients had low complement (C) 3 levels and the presence of polyclonal immunoglobulin C3 nephritic factor. Twenty-two percent of patients developed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) after a median of approximately 8 years following the onset of lipodystrophy. Compared with patients without renal disease, those with MPGN had earlier age of onset of lipodystrophy (12.6 +/- 10.3 yr vs 7.7 +/- 4.4 yr, respectively; p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of C3 hypocomplementemia (78% vs 95%, respectively; p = 0.02).The adipose stores of the gluteal regions and lower extremities (including soles) tend to be either preserved or increased, particularly among women.[9] Variable fat loss of the palms, but no loss of intramarrow or retro-orbital fat, has been demonstrated.Approximately 250 cases have been reported since the recognition of this syndrome.[10] It is a rare syndrome with no known prevalence, although it is more common than the generalized form of acquired lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome).RaceNo clear relationship exists between incidence and race in this syndrome; however, most reported patients have been of European descent.SexWomen are affected approximately 4 times more often than men.AgeThe median age of onset of lipodystrophy has been reported to be around 7 years; however, onset occurring as late as the 4th or 5th decade of life also has been reported.The median age at presentation has been about 25 years, and women have been found to present later than men (age 28 y vs 18 y).The etiology of this condition is has not been fully elucidated.[11] Lipodystrophy is often associated with glomerulonephritis, low C3 serum complement levels, and the presence of a C3 nephritic factor. C3 nephritic factor is a serum immunoglobulin G that interacts with the C3bBb alternative pathway convertase to activate C3.C3 nephritic factor induces the lysis of adipocytes that secrete adipsin, a product identical to complement factor D. The distribution of the lipoatrophy is postulated to be dictated by the variable amounts of adipsin secreted by the adipocytes at different locations.Human PTRF mutations may cause secondary deficiency of caveolins, resulting in generalized lipodystrophy in association with in muscular dystrophyComplement dysfunction may presdispose some patients to bacterial infections.[10]The diagnosis of the disease is mainly clinical (see diagnostic criteria).The laboratory workup is needed primarily to investigate for the presence of associated disorders (metabolic, autoimmune, and renal diseases).[10]•Every patient should have a fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, creatinine evaluation, and urinalysis for protein content at the first visit, after which he/she should have these tests on a regular basis.•Although uncommon, lipid abnormalities can occur in the form of raised triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.•Patients usually have decreased serum C3 levels, normal levels of C1 and C4, and high levels of C3NeF (autoantibody), which may indicate the presence of renal involvement.•Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti–double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) antibodies have reportedly been observed in some patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy.•A genetic workup should be performed if the familial form of lipodystrophy is suggested. Laboratory work for associated diseases includes the following:•Metabolic disease - Fasting glucose, glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, and fasting insulin to characterize the insulin resistance state; free testosterone (in women) to look for polycystic ovary syndrome•Autoimmune disease - ANA, anti–double-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, thyroid antibodies, C3, and C3NeFAs a confirmatory test, whole-body MRI usually clearly demonstrates the extent of lipodystrophy. MRI is not recommended on a routine basis.In general, treatment for acquired partial lipodystrophy is limited to cosmetic, dietary, or medical options.[10] Currently, no effective treatment exists to halt the progression of lipodystrophy.DietDiet therapy has been shown to be of some value in the control of metabolic problems. The use of small, frequent feedings and partial substitution of medium-chain triglycerides for polyunsaturated fats appears to be beneficial.SurgicalPlastic surgery with implants of monolithic silicon rubber for correction of the deficient soft tissue of the face has been shown to be effective. False teeth may be useful in some cases for cosmetic reasons. Long-term treatment usually involves therapy for kidney and endocrine dysfunction.MedicationsData on medications for APL is very limited. Thiazolidinediones have been used in the management of various types of lipodystrophies. They bind to peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which stimulates the transcription of genes responsible for growth and differentiation of adipocytes. A single report has suggested a beneficial effect from treatment with rosiglitazone on fat distribution in acquired partial lipodystrophy ; however, preferential fat gain was in the lower body.Direct drug therapy is administered according to the associated condition.•Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and the presence of renal dysfunction largely determine the prognosis of acquired partial lipodystrophy. Standard guidelines for the management of renal disease should be followed.•The course of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in acquired partial lipodystrophy has not been significantly altered by treatment with corticosteroids or cytotoxic medications.•Recurrent bacterial infections, if severe, might be managed with prophylactic antibiotics.Estimating the mortality rate based on the available literature is difficult.[10] Several case reports have revealed an association between acquired partial lipodystrophy and other diseases (see the list of disorders associated with acquired partial lipodystrophy).•Nephropathy, in the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, occurs in approximately 20% of patients.•Usually, patients do not have clinically evident renal disease or abnormalities in renal function until they have had the disease for 8 or more years.◦Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis usually presents with asymptomatic proteinuria or hematuria.◦The disease may gradually progress. About 40-50% of patients develop end-stage renal disease over the course of 10 years. This condition is responsible for most recurrent hospital admissions in patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy.◦Rapid progression of renal disease in a pregnant patient was reported.◦Recurrent disease in transplanted kidneys is common, although there have been reports of successful transplantations.•Associated autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis) contribute significantly to increased morbidity in these patients compared with the general population.•Although uncommon, insulin resistance increases cardiovascular risk.•Susceptibility to bacterial infections probably results from a C3 deficiency (due to complement activation and consumption of C3).

It is the most common form of a group of disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (or NCLs).Although Batten disease is usually regarded as the juvenile form of NCL (or \"type 3\"), some physicians use the term Batten disease to describe all forms of NCL. Historically, the NCLs were classified by age of disease onset as infantile NCL (INCL), late infantile NCL (LINCL), juvenile NCL (JNCL) or adult NCL (ANCL).[1]At least twenty genes have been identified in association with Batten disease, but juvenile NCL, the most prevalent form of Batten disease, has been linked to mutations in the CLN3 gene.[2][3]Early symptoms of the disorder usually appear around ages 2–10, with gradual onset of vision problems, or seizures. Early signs may be subtle personality and behavior changes, slow learning or regression, repetitive speech or echolalia, clumsiness, or stumbling. There may be slowing head growth in the infantile form, poor circulation in lower extremities (legs and feet), decreased body fat and muscle mass, curvature of the spine, hyperventilation and/or breath-holding spells, teeth grinding, and constipation.Over time, affected children suffer mental impairment, worsening seizures, and progressive loss of sight, speech and motor skills. Eventually, children with Batten disease become blind, bedridden, and demented, and may possibly die. Batten Disease is a life threatening disease; life expectancy varies depending on the type or variation.Batten disease is named after the British pediatrician Frederick Batten, who first described it in 1903.[4][5] Also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjögren-Batten disease, it is the most common form of a group of disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (or NCLs). Although Batten disease is usually regarded as the juvenile form of NCL, some physicians use the term Batten disease to describe all forms of NCL.Batten disease is inherited primarily in an autosomal recessive pattern, but it varies by age. In cases involving children, it is only inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In adults, the inheritance pattern is still autosomally recessive but there is also a chance of it being inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion as well. Eight genes have been identified in the variety of NCLs, mutations in which contribute to the development of the phenotypic trait of the disorders:CLN1, also known as PPT1, encodes an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 that is insufficiently active in Infantile NCL. CLN 2, or TPP1, produces an enzyme called tripeptidyl peptidase 1—an acid protease that degrades proteins. The enzyme is insufficiently active in Late Infantile NCL (also referred to as CLN2). CLN3 mutation is the major cause of Juvenile NCL. The gene codes for a protein called CLN3 or battenin, which is found in the membranes of the cell (most predominantly in lysosomes and in related structures called endosomes). The protein’s function is currently unknown. CLN5, which causes variant Late Infantile NCL (vLINCL, also referred to as CLN5), produces a lysosomal protein called CLN5, whose function has not been identified. CLN6, which also causes Late Infantile NCL, encodes a protein called CLN6 or linclin. The protein is found in the membranes of the cell (most predominantly in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum). Its function has not been identified. MFSD8, seen in variant Late Infantile NCL (also referred to as CLN7), encodes the MFSD8 protein that is a member of a protein family called the major facilitator superfamily. This superfamily is involved with transporting substances across the cell membranes. The precise function of MFSD8 has not been identified. CLN8 causes progressive epilepsy with mental retardation. The gene encodes a protein also called CLN8, which is found in the membranes of the cell—most predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein’s function has not been identified. CTSD, involved with Congenital NCL (also referred to as CLN10), encodes cathepsin D, a lysosomal enzyme that breaks apart other proteins. A deficiency of cathepsin D causes the disorder.The mutation causes the buildup of lipofuscins in the body's tissues. These substances consist of fats and proteins and form certain distinctive deposits that cause the symptoms and can be seen under an electron microscope. The diagnosis of Batten disease is based on the presence of these deposits in skin samples as well as other criteria. Eight genes have now been identified that cause different types of Batten disease in children or adults, more having yet to be identified. Two of these genes encode enzymes. The function of most of these genes is still unknown. The identification of these genes opens up the possibility of gene replacement therapy or other gene-related treatments. Batten disease is very rare and occurs in an estimated 2 to 4 out of every 100,000 births in the United States.[6]In many instances, Batten Disease is initially seen by an ophthalmologist during an eye exam because one of the first signs is vision loss. Even though it is also seen in a variety of other diseases as well, a loss of ocular cells should be a warning sign or Batten Disease potentially being present. If Batten Disease is a possible diagnosis for an individual, a variety of tests are run to confirm including:Blood or urine tests. These tests can detect abnormalities that may indicate Batten disease. For example, elevated levels of a chemical called dolichol are found in the urine of many individuals with NCL. The presence of vacuolated lymphocytes—white blood cells that contain holes or cavities (observed by microscopic analysis of blood smears)—when combined with other findings that indicate NCL, is suggestive for the juvenile form caused by CLN3 mutations. Skin or tissue sampling. The doctor can examine a small piece of tissue under an electron microscope. The powerful magnification of the microscope helps the doctor spot typical NCL deposits. These deposits are common in skin cells, especially those from sweat glands. Electroencephalogram or EEG. An EEG uses special patches placed on the scalp to record electrical currents inside the brain. This helps doctors see telltale patterns in the brain's electrical activity that suggest an individual has seizures. Electrical studies of the eyes. These tests, which include visual-evoked responses and electroretinograms, can detect various eye problems common in childhood NCLs. Diagnostic Imaging using Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Diagnostic imaging can help doctors look for changes in the brain's appearance. CT uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures, and may reveal brain areas that are decaying, or “atrophic,” in persons with NCL. MRI uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain. Measurement of Enzyme Activity. Measurement of the activity of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase involved in CLN1, the acid protease involved in CLN2, and, though more rare, cathepsin D activity involved in CLN10, in white blood cells or cultured skin fibroblasts (cells that strengthen skin and give it elasticity) can be used to confirm or rule out these diagnoses. DNA Analysis. If families where the mutation in the gene for CLN3 is known, DNA analysis can be used to confirm the diagnosis or for the prenatal diagnosis of this form of Batten disease. When the mutation is known, DNA analysis can also be used to detect unaffected carriers of this condition for genetic counseling. If a family mutation has not previously been identified or if the common mutations are not present, recent molecular advanced have made it possible to sequence all of the known NCL genes, increasing the chances of finding the responsible mutation(s). [7]In June 1987, a Phase I clinical trial was launched at Weill Medical College of Cornell University to study a gene therapy method for treatment of the signs and symptoms of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL). The experimental drug works by delivering a gene transfer vector called AAV2CUhCLN2 to the brain.[8] In 2011, it was reported that the procedure, which involved injecting a harmless gene-bearing virus into the brain, is safe; and that, on average, it significantly slowed the disease's progression during the 18-month follow-up period.[9]In November 2006, after receiving FDA clearance, neurosurgeon Dr. Nathan Selden, pediatrician Dr. Fredirich Steiner, and colleagues at Doernbecher Children's Hospital at Oregon Health & Science University began a clinical study in which purified neural stem cells were injected into the brain of a six-year-old child with Batten disease, who had lost the ability to walk and talk. This patient was the first of six to receive the injection of a stem cell product from StemCells Inc., a Palo Alto biotech company. These are believed to be the first-ever transplants of fetal stem cells into the human brain.[10] By early December, the child had recovered well enough to return home, and it was reported that there were some signs of speech returning.[11] The main goal of Phase I clinical trials, however, was to investigate the safety of transplantation. Overall, the Phase I data demonstrated that high doses of human neural stem cells, delivered by a direct transplantation procedure into multiple sites within the brain, followed by twelve months of immunosuppression, were well tolerated by all six patients enrolled in the trial. The patients’ medical, neurological and neuropsychological conditions, following transplantation, appeared consistent with the normal course of the disease.[12]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:45 UTC +00:00]]

Behçet's disease (BD) was named in 1937 after the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet, who first described the triple-symptom complex of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis. As a systemic disease, it can also involve visceral organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and neurological systems. This syndrome can be fatal due to ruptured vascular aneurysms or severe neurological complications.[3]Behçet disease is named after Hulusi Behçet (1889–1948), the Turkish dermatologist and scientist who first recognized the syndrome in one of his patients in 1924 and reported his research on the disease in Journal of Skin and Venereal Diseases in 1936.[4][5] The name (Morbus Behçet) was formally adopted at the International Congress of Dermatology in Geneva in September 1947. Symptoms of this disease may have been described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC, in his 3rd Epidemion-book.[6] Its first modern formal description was published in 1922.[4]Some sources use the term \"Adamantiades’ syndrome\" or \"Adamandiades-Behçet syndrome\", for the work done by Benediktos Adamantiades.[7] However, the current World Health Organization/ICD-10 standard is \"Behçet's disease\". In 1991, Saudi Arabian medical researchers described neuro-Behçet's disease,[8] a neurological involvement in Behçet's disease, considered one of the most devastating manifestations of the disease.[9] The mechanism can be immune-mediated or thrombotic.[10] The term dates back to at least 1990.[11]Nearly all patients present with some form of painful oral mucocutaneous ulcerations in the form of aphthous ulcers or non-scarring oral lesions.[3] The oral lesions are similar to those found in inflammatory bowel disease and can be relapsing.[3] Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75% of the patients.[3] Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum.[3]Inflammatory eye disease can develop early in the disease course and lead to permanent vision loss in 20% of cases. Ocular involvement can be in the form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.[12] Optic nerve atrophy has been identified as the most common cause of visual impairment. Behçet's disease may result in primary or secondary optic nerve involvement. Papilledema as a result of dural sinus thrombosis[13] and atrophy resulting from retinal disease, have been characterized as secondary causes of optic nerve atrophy in Behçet's disease.[14][15]Signs and symptoms of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.GI manifestations include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea with or without blood, and they often involve the ileocecal valve.[3] Many patients with BD often complain about abdominal tenderness, bloating, and generic abdominal discomfort that closely mimics irritable bowel syndrome.Lung involvement is typically in the form of hemoptysis, pleuritis, cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life threatening if the outlet pulmonary artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs.[3] Nodules, consolidations, cavities and ground glass lesions are common in patients with pulmonary involvement.[16] Pulmonary artery thrombosis may occur.Arthralgia is seen in up to half of patients, and is usually a non-erosive poly or oligoarthritis primarily of the large joints of the lower extremities.[3]CNS involvement most often occurs as a chronic meningoencephalitis. Lesions tend to occur in the brainstem, the basal ganglia and deep hemispheric white matter and may resemble those of MS. Brainstem atrophy is seen in chronic cases.Neurological involvements range from aseptic meningitis to vascular thrombosis such as dural sinus thrombosis and organic brain syndrome manifesting with confusion, seizures, and memory loss.[3] They often appear late in the progression of the disease but are associated with a poor prognosis.Pericarditis is a frequent cardiac manifestation.[16] Chronic aortic regurgitation due to aortic root disease may also be seen.[17]The cause is not well-defined, but it is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels. Although sometimes erroneously referred to as a \"diagnosis of exclusion,\" the diagnosis can sometimes be reached by pathologic examination of the affected areas.[18]The primary mechanism of the damage is an overactive immune system that seems to target the patient's own body. The involvement of a subset of T cells (Th17) seems to be important.[16] The primary cause is not well known. In fact, no one knows yet why the immune system starts to behave this way in Behçet's disease. There does however seem to be a genetic component involved, as first degree relatives of the affected patients are often affected in more than expected proportion for the general population.[citation needed]An association with the GIMAP family of genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q36.1) has been reported.[19] The genes implicated were GIMAP1, GIMAP2 and GIMAP4.Behçet's disease is considered more prevalent in the areas surrounding the old silk trading routes in the Middle East and in Central Asia. Thus, it is sometimes known as Silk Road Disease. However, this disease is not restricted to people from these regions. A large number of serological studies show a linkage between the disease and HLA-B51.[21] HLA-B51 is more frequently found from the Middle East to South Eastern Siberia, but the incidence of B51 in some studies was 3 fold higher than the normal population. However, B51 tends not to be found in disease when a certain SUMO4 gene variant is involved,[22] and symptoms appear to be milder when HLA-B27 is present.[23] At the current time, a similar infectious origin has not yet been confirmed that leads to Behçet's disease, but certain strains of Streptococcus sanguinis has been found to have a homologous antigenicity.[24]Vasculitis resulting in occlusion of the vessels supplying the optic nerve may be the cause of acute optic neuropathy and progressive optic atrophy in Behçet's disease. Histological evaluation in a reported case of acute optic neuropathy demonstrated substitution of the axonal portion of the optic nerve with fibrous astrocytes without retinal changes.[15] CNS involvement in Behçet's may lead to intracranial hypertension most commonly due to dural venous sinus thrombosis[13] [8-10] and subsequent secondary optic atrophy.There is no specific pathological testing or technique available for the diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a pathergy test.[3][25] Behçet's disease has a high degree of resemblance to diseases that cause mucocutaneous lesions such as Herpes simplex labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the differential diagnosis.Visual acuity, or color vision loss with concurrent mucocutaneous lesions and/or systemic Behçet's symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed in addition to an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.According to the International Study Group guidelines, for a patient to be diagnosed with Behçet's disease,[25] the patient must have oral (aphthous) ulcers (any shape, size, or number at least 3 times in any 12 months period) along with 2 out of the following 4 \"hallmark\" symptoms:Despite the inclusive criteria set forth by the International Study Group, there are cases where not all the criteria can be met and therefore a diagnosis cannot readily be made. There is however a set of clinical findings that a physician can rely upon in making a tentative diagnosis of the disease; essentially Behçet's disease does not always follow the International Study Group guidelines and so a high degree of suspicion for a patient who presents having any number of the following findings is necessary:Current treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. High dose Corticosteroid therapy (1 mg/kg/d oral prednisone) is indicated for severe disease manifestations.[26]Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease.[27][28] Another Anti-TNF agent, Etanercept, may be useful in patients with mainly skin and mucosal symptoms.[29]Interferon alfa-2a may also be an effective alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers[30] as well as ocular lesions.[31]Azathioprine, when used in combination with interferon alfa-2b also shows promise,[32] and Colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and arthritis.[33]Thalidomide has also been used due to its immune-modifying effect.[34]Dapsone and rebamipide have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for mucocutaneous lesions.[35][36]Given its rarity, the optimal treatment for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease has not been established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment.[37]Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment may be required to prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.IVIG could be a treatment for severe[38] or complicated cases.[39][40]The syndrome is rare in the United States, but is common in the Middle East and Asia, suggesting a possible cause endemic to the tropical areas.[41] It is not associated with cancer, and links with tissue-types (which are under investigation) are not certain. It also does not follow the usual pattern for autoimmune diseases. However, one study has revealed a possible connection to food allergies, particularly to dairy products.[42] An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Americans have been diagnosed with this disease. In the UK, it is estimated to have about 1 case for every 100,000 people.[43] Globally, males are affected more frequently than females.[44] In the United States, more females are affected than males.[citation needed]In an epidemiologic study, 56% of patients with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at a mean age of 30.[45] Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6% of patients.[45] Ocular Behçet's with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%),[14] retinal hemorrhage(9%),[14] macular edema(11.3%),[14] branch retinal vein occlusion(5.8%),[14] and retinal edema (6.6%).[14] However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54% of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.[14]The prevalence of this disease increases from North to South. It follows a more severe course in patients with an early age of onset particularly in patients with eye and gastrointestinal involvement.[46]With Behçet's as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy, the pregnancy does not have an adverse effect on the course of Behçet's disease and may possibly ameliorate its course.[47][48] Still, there is a substantial variability in clinical course between patients and even for different pregnancies in the same patient.[47] Also, the other way around, Behçet's disease confers an increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriage and Cesarean section.[48]M: MUS, DF+DRCTanat (h/n, u, t/d, a/p, l)/phys/devp/histnoco (m, s, c)/cong (d)/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M1A/3)M: MOUanat/devpnoco/cofa (c)/cogi/tumr, sysiproc (peri), drug (A1)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:45 UTC +00:00]]

These episodes are called ketoacidotic attacks and can sometimes lead to coma. Attacks occur when compounds called organic acids (which are formed as products of amino acid and fat breakdown) build up to toxic levels in the blood. These attacks are often triggered by an infection, fasting (not eating), or in some cases, other types of stress.This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is extremely rare having only been reported in 50 to 60 individuals throughout the world.Mutations in the ACAT1 gene cause beta-ketothiolase deficiency. The enzyme made by the ACAT1 gene plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats in the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing isoleucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. This enzyme also processes ketones, which are produced during the breakdown of fats. If a mutation in the ACAT1 gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to process isoleucine and ketones properly. As a result, harmful compounds can build up and cause the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis), which impairs tissue function, especially in the central nervous system.This article incorporates public domain text from The U.S. National Library of MedicineM: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:46 UTC +00:00]]

As a birth defect in newborn infants, it has an occurrence of 1/10,000 to 1/15,000 cases in live births in the United States.[1] In the congenital form, the common bile duct between the liver and the small intestine is blocked or absent. The acquired type most often occurs in the setting of autoimmune disease, and is one of the principal forms of chronic rejection of a transplanted liver allograft.Infants and children with biliary atresia have progressive cholestasis with all the usual concomitant features: jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption with growth retardation, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, hyperlipidemia, and eventually cirrhosis with portal hypertension. If unrecognized, the condition leads to liver failure—but not kernicterus, as the liver is still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier. The cause of the condition is unknown. The only effective treatments are certain surgeries such as the kasai procedure, or liver transplantation, both of which, have proven effective in only a small number of historical cases.Initially, the symptoms are indistinguishable from neonatal jaundice, a common phenomenon. Symptoms are usually evident between one and six weeks after birth. Besides jaundice, other symptoms include pale stools, dark urine, swollen abdominal region and large hardened liver (which may or may not be observable by the naked eye). Prolonged jaundice that is resistant to photo therapy and/or exchange transfusions should prompt a search for secondary causes. By this time, liver enzymes are generally measured, and these tend to be grossly deranged, hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated and therefore does not lead to kernicterus. Ultrasound investigation or other forms of imaging can confirm the diagnosis. Further testing includes radioactive scans of the liver and a liver biopsy.Biliary atresia seems to affect girls slightly more often than boys. Within the same family, it is common for only one child in a pair of twins or only one child within the same family to have it. Asians and African-Americans are affected more frequently than Caucasians. There does not appear to be any link to medications or immunizations given immediately before or during pregnancy.There is no known cause of biliary atresia. There have been many theories about etiopathogenesis such as Reovirus 3 infection, congenital malformation, congenital CMV infection, autoimmune theory. This means that the etiology and pathogenesis of biliary atresia are largely unknown.However, there have been extensive studies about the pathogenesis and proper management of progressive liver fibrosis, which is arguably one of the most important aspects of biliary atresia patients. As the biliary tract cannot transport bile to the intestine, bile is retained in the liver (known as stasis) and results in cirrhosis of the liver. Proliferation of the small bile ductules occur, and peribiliary fibroblasts become activated. These \"reactive\" biliary epithelial cells in cholestasis, unlike normal condition, produce and secrete various cytokines such as CCL-2 or MCP-1, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-beta, Endothelin (ET), and nitric oxide (NO). Among these, TGF-beta is the most important profibrogenic cytokine that can be seen in liver fibrosis in chronic cholestasis. During the chronic activation of biliary epithelium and progressive fibrosis, afflicted patients eventually show signs and symptoms of portal hypertension (esophagogastric varix bleeding, hypersplenism, hepatorenal syndrome(HRS), hepatopulmonary syndrome(HPS)). The latter two syndromes are essentially caused by systemic mediators that maintain the body within the hyperdynamic states.There are three main types of extrahepatic biliary atresia:Associated anomalies include, in about 10% cases, cardiac lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent vena cava, and a preduodenal portal vein.If the intrahepatic biliary tree is unaffected, surgical reconstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tract is possible. This surgery is called a Kasai procedure (after the Japanese surgeon who developed the surgery, Dr. Morio Kasai) or hepatoportoenterostomy. This procedure is not usually curative, but ideally does buy time until the child can achieve growth and undergo liver transplantation.If the atresia is complete, liver transplantation is the only option. Timely Kasai portoenterostomy (e.g. < 60 postnatal days) has shown better outcomes. Nevertheless, a considerable number of the patients, even if Kasai portoenterostomy has been successful, eventually undergo liver transplantation within a couple of years after Kasai portoenterostomy.Recent large volume studies from Davenport et al. (Ann Surg, 2008) show that age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting the prognosis. In the latter study, influence of age differs according to the disease etiology—i.e., whether isolated BA, BASM (BA with splenic malformation ), or CBA(cystic biliary atresia).It is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a Kasai operation, with or without choleretics and antibiotics, has a beneficial effect on the postoperative bile flow and can clear the jaundice; but the dosing and duration of the ideal steroid protocol have been controversial (\"blast dose\" vs. \"high dose\" vs. \"low dose\"). Furthermore, it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that steroid does not prolong survival of the native liver or transplant-free survival. Davenport et al. also showed (hepatology 2007) that short-term low-dose steroid therapy following a Kasai operation has no effect on the mid- and long-term prognosis of biliary atresia patients.A possible association with the gene GPC1 which encodes a glypican 1-a heparan sulfate proteoglycan has been reported.[2] This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37). This gene is involved in the regulation of the gene Hedgehog and also of inflammation. In addition to the association of mutations in the gene and the abnormally low levels of this protein in human cases, knock out mutants in zebra fish develop similar lesions in the liver. Hedgehog inhibitors ameliorate the features in the mutated fish and the addition of hedgehog to normal fish produce lesions.As of 2013[update], numerous individuals are known to have undergone the Kasai procedure and lived for more than a few years without requiring additional surgeries. Because of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, their names are not available. However, a group exists on Facebook as well as other social networking sites, where patients and/or families share their stories, both successes and hardships.M: MOUanat/devpnoco/cofa (c)/cogi/tumr, sysiproc (peri), drug (A1)M: DIGanat (t, g, p)/phys/devp/enzynoco/cong/tumr, sysi/eponproc, drug (A2A/2B/3/4/5/6/7/14/16), blte"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:46 UTC +00:00]]

It causes severe, progressive inflammation of both the choroid and retina.Affected individuals are usually diagnosed in the fourth to sixth decade of their lives.[1]Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a rare form of posterior uveitis and accounts for 1-3% of uveitis cases in general. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The disease has strong association with the Human leukocyte antigen haplotype (HLA)-A29, which is the strongest association between a disease and HLA class I documented (85 to 97.5% of patients are HLA-A29 positive). This indicates a role for T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is associated with IL-17, a hallmark cytokine of TH17 cells that play an important role in autoimmunity .[2] The disease affects typically middle aged or elderly caucasians. HLA-A29 is less prevalent in Asia and no birdshot chorioretinopathy cases have been reported in Asia. When birdshot chorioretinopathy is suspected, a person is usually tested to determine if they are HLA-A29 positive. However, HLA-A29 testing is not considered necessary for definitive diagnosis because HLA-A29 is also common in the general healthy population (7%). Additional (genetic or environmental) or unknown factors may be associated with HLA-A29 in the pathogenesis.Symptoms of this disorder include floaters, blurred vision, photopsia (flashing lights in eyes), loss of color vision and nyctalopia. In eye examination light-colored spots on the retina is seen. Complete loss of visual acuity may happen.The name of the condition comes from the small light-colored fundus spots on the retina, scattered in a pattern like birdshot from a shotgun, but these spots might not be present in early stages.Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy alongside with oral corticosteroid have been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual intregrity as much as possible. Long-term use of such medications must be closely monitored, however, due to the discomforting, and potentially debilitating and life-threatening side-effects.[3][3][4]Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody Daclizumab, Cyclosporine and Methotrexate have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction, and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis has been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported by the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients.[2] Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug. This is reflected by the lack of difference in visual acuity and the vision-related quality of life between various treatment categories in birdshot patients.[5] Contraindications and adverse side-effects are always a factor, as well.[6][1]M: EYEanat (g/a/p)/phys/devp/protnoco/cong/tumr, eponproc, drug (S1A/1E/1F/1L)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:46 UTC +00:00]]

The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas are the most common manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.Any of these conditions that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, it appears to be a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome can manifest similarly to other diseases, which must be ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome affects the skin and increases the risk of tumors in the kidneys and lungs. The condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous dome-shaped tumors of the hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas), particularly on the face, neck, and—more rarely—the upper chest.[2] The fibrofolliculomas are generally described as having an opaque white color[3] or a yellowish tone[4] and have a waxy, smooth texture.[3] The tumors are always found on and around the nose and on and behind the outer ear. Typically, they first appear in a person's 20s or 30s, and are found in more than 80% of people with the syndrome above the age of 40.[2] The tumors become larger and more numerous over time.[5] Tumors differ between individuals: they may appear merged in plaques, look similar to a comedo with a plug of keratin, or include epidermoid cysts. A large number of tumors on the face can be associated with hyperseborrhea (abnormally elevated sebum production).[2] The presence of fibrofolliculomas on a person's face can cause significant psychological distress.[6]Other tumors can include trichodiscomas (tumors of the hair disc, which may be identical to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas.[5] However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis.[6] Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium.[2]Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families.[5] Many people with BHD have skin lesions that appear to be acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin.[3] Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.[5]People over 20 years of age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome have an increased risk of developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues.[2] These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney.[5] The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found.[7] Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases,[8] is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma.[5][8] People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48.[2][5] Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.[6]In general, people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are at roughly seven times the risk of kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%.[2][8] Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma.[5] If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis.[9] Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.[8]Along with fibrofolliculomas and kidney tumors, affected individuals frequently develop cysts (blebs or bullae) in the subpleural lung base or intraparenchymal space that may rupture and cause an abnormal collection of air in the chest cavity (pneumothorax), which could result in the collapse of a lung.[5][10] The cysts do not cause other symptoms[5] and lung function is usually normal.[6] More than 83% of people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have cysts, however, the syndrome does not cause conditions like progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or generalized respiratory failure,[2] though it does cause emphysema.[4] Spontaneous, sometimes recurrent,[5] pneumothorax occurs far more often and at a younger age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé than in the unaffected population. Approximately 24% of people with the disease suffer at least one spontaneous pneumothorax, 30 times the occurrence in unaffected people. Though pneumothorax caused by Birt–Hogg–Dubé often occurs in middle age, at a median age of 38, 17% of affected people have a spontaneous pneumothorax before turning 40.[2] Pneumothoraces have been seen in people as young as 7 and 16 years of age.[6] Some families have a form of BHD that only affects the lungs.[11]Thyroid nodules[2] have been associated with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome.[2] However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated.[3] Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis,[12]connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face,[3]trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.[6]An association with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002.[13] This 14-exon gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation.[2][5] The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is no significant difference in the symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus.[14][3] Very rarely, missense mutations are observed.[6] Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation).[15] The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance.[5] A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.[15]FLCN creates a protein called folliculin that has two isoforms.[3] It appears to act as a tumor suppressor and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes.[5] It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries.[8][4] Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.[16] Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase.[8][4] Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.[3]Most of the cancer-causing mutations cause the protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus.[8] The C-terminal end of folliculin has shown to be the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway.[14] FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species.[5] The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position is found to be conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating that it is important to the protein's function.[14]People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are born with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell.[6]Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check.[1] During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, the result is that these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes.[6] FLCN has been found to be overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys.[4] Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.[7]BHD can be suggested by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene. The classical clinical triad includes benign growths of the hair follicles; pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and bilateral, multifocal renal tumors.[5]The cutaneous manifestations of Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often found on the face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered on the basis of cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.[5]FLCN mutations are detected by sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means that some people with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of and to provide a means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.[5][6]Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be difficult to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.[5]Hereditary recurrent pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts are associated with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination.[5] In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.[9]Though fibrofolliculomas are unique to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an ambiguous appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.[5] Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.[6]The different manifestations of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, this is not a permanent solution as the tumors often recur.[2][5] The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke.[2] MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds.[6] Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers.[17][6] Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy.[5]Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.[6]The disorder has been reported in more than 100 families worldwide,[14] though some sources cite up to 400 families,[1] and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is considered to be under-diagnosed[3][6] because of the variability in its expression.[18] The pattern of mutations and spectrum of symptoms are heterogeneous between individuals.[14] Less severe skin phenotypes are seen in women and people of both sexes who have a late onset of skin symptoms.[5]The syndrome was first well described in 1977,[19] by three Canadian physicians, Arthur R. Birt, Georgina R. Hogg and William J. Dubé. The earliest case of possible BHD in the medical literature was published by Burnier and Rejsek in 1927,[20] who described a case of perifollicular fibromas on a 56-year-old woman's face. Trichodiscomas were first described in 1974 by H.S. Zackheim and H. Pinkus, but were not associated with BHD until Birt, Hogg, and Dubé.[3] The first case of BHD with the systemic symptoms was described by Hornstein and Knickenberg and found in two siblings and their father, all of whom exhibited colon polyps and the characteristic fibrofolliculomas.[21] Though the siblings did not have renal or pulmonary symptoms, their father had cysts in his lungs and kidneys.[3] Hornstein-Knickenberg syndrome is a now-deprecated name for the inherited fibrofolliculomas inherent to Birt–Hogg–Dubé.[5]Birt, Hogg, and Dubé examined a family with a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered that many of the members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986;[3] the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993[6] and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999.[4] It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven.[2] The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.[22][23][24]Genes related to FLCN and diseases similar to BHD have been found in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity.[6] Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.[3]A homolog of FLCN called DBHD has been discovered in the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.[25][3] When this gene is underexpressed, signaling pathways that maintain the stem cell niche in the adult male testes are dysregulated.[3]A line of rats with hereditary kidney cancer were developed by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth.[3] When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.[6]Knockout mice have been created for a kidney-cancer causing mutation of BHD; heterozygotes develop kidney cysts and tumors that lead to renal failure within three weeks of birth. In these mice, the mTOR pathway was inappropriately activated, indicating that the mouse homolog of FLCN plays a regulatory role in this pathway. Rapamycin partially rescued the phenotype by regulating mTOR. Homozygotes die in utero.[3]CitationsBibliographyPilomatricoma/Malignant pilomatricoma ·  Trichoepithelioma (Multiple familial trichoepithelioma, Solitary trichoepithelioma, Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, Generalized trichoepithelioma) ·  Trichodiscoma ·  Trichoblastoma ·  Fibrofolliculoma ·  Trichilemmoma ·  Trichilemmal carcinoma ·  Proliferating trichilemmal cyst ·  Giant solitary trichoepithelioma · Trichoadenoma ·  Trichofolliculoma ·  Dilated poreIsthmicoma ·  Fibrofolliculoma ·  Perifollicular fibroma ·  Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndromeM: SKAanat/phys/devpnoco/cong/tumr, sysi/eponproc, drug (D10)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:46 UTC +00:00]]

Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive homologous recombination. The condition was discovered and first described by New York dermatologist Dr. David Bloom in 1954.[5]Bloom syndrome is a type of progeroid syndrome, and shows much of the common characteristics, such as short stature and a rash that develops early in life in sun-exposed areas of the skin. The skin rash is erythematous, telangiectatic, infiltrated, and scaly, and it appears in the butterfly-shaped patch of skin across the nose and on the cheeks. The rash can develop on other sun-exposed areas such as the backs of the hands. Other clinical features include a high-pitched voice; distinct facial features, such as a long, narrow face, micrognathism, and prominent nose and ears; pigmentation changes of the skin including hypo- and hyper-pigmented areas and cafe-au-lait spots; telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels) which can appear on the skin but also in the eyes; moderate immune deficiency, characterized by deficiency in certain immunoglobulin classes, that apparently leads to recurrent pneumonia and ear infections; hypogonadism characterized by a failure to produce sperm, hence infertility in males, and premature cessation of menses (premature menopause), hence sub-fertility in females. However, several women with Bloom syndrome have had children.Complications of the disorder may include chronic lung problems, diabetes, and learning disabilities. In a small number of persons, there is mental retardation. The most striking complication of the disorder is susceptibility to cancer, as described in more detail in the next section.Bloom syndrome shares many phenotypes with Fanconi anemia and this may be because of overlap in the function of the proteins mutated in this related disorder.[6]A greatly elevated rate of mutation in Bloom syndrome results in a high risk of cancer in affected individuals.[7] The cancer predisposition is characterized by 1) broad spectrum, including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas, 2) early age of onset relative to the same cancer in the general population, and 3) multiplicity.[8] Persons with Bloom's syndrome may develop cancer at any age. The average age of cancer diagnoses in the cohort is approximately 25 years old.Mutations in the BLM gene (located at 15q26.1), which is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, are associated with Bloom syndrome. DNA helicases are enzymes that unwind the two strands of a duplex DNA molecule. DNA unwinding is required for most processes that involve the DNA, including synthesis of DNA copies, RNA transcription, DNA repair, etc.When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the chromosomes are duplicated so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. The duplication process is called DNA replication. Errors made during DNA replication can lead to mutations. The BLM protein is important in maintaining the stability of the DNA during the replication process. The mutations in the BLM gene associated with Bloom's syndrome inactivate the BLM protein's DNA helicase activity or nullify protein expression (the protein is not made). Lack of BLM protein or protein activity leads to an increase mutations; however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BLM maintains stability of the chromosomes is still a very active area of research.Persons with Bloom syndrome have an enormous increase in exchange events between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids (the two DNA molecules that are produced by the DNA replication process); and there are increases in chromosome breakage and rearrangements compared to persons who do not have Bloom's syndrome. Direct connections between the molecular processes in which BLM operates and the chromosomes themselves are under investigation. The relationships between molecular defects in Bloom syndrome cells, the chromosome mutations that accumulate in somatic cells (the cells of the body), and the many clinical features seen in Bloom syndrome are also areas of intense research.Bloom syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. The carrier frequency in individuals of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi Jewish) ancestry is about 1/100. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. As a consequence of this inheritance, the syndrome affects males and females equally; however, females are perhaps slightly under-diagnosed as the skin lesion can be perhaps less severe in females. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families who may be carriers of Bloom syndrome. For families in which carrier status is known, prenatal testing is available using cytogenetic or molecular methods. Molecular DNA testing for the mutation that is common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is also available. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the symptoms of Bloom syndrome vary depending on the types of mutations a person inherits.Bloom syndrome is diagnosed using any of three tests - the presence of quadriradial (Qr, a four-armed chromatid interchange) in cultured blood lymphocytes, and/or the elevated levels of Sister chromatid exchange in cells of any type, and/or the mutation in the BLM gene.[9]M: INT, SF, LCTanat/phys/devpnoco (i/b/d/q/u/r/p/m/k/v/f)/cong/tumr (n/e/d), sysi/eponproc, drug (D2/3/4/5/8/11)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:46 UTC +00:00]]

One such disorder, atelosteogenesis type I, is very similar to boomerang dysplasia, and several symptoms of both often overlap.[8][9]Early journal reports of boomerang dysplasia suggested X-linked recessive inheritance, based on observation and family history.[3] It was later discovered, however, that the disorder is actually caused by a sporadic genetic mutation fitting an autosomal dominant genetic profile.[8]Autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.Boomerang dysplasia, although an autosomal dominant disorder,[8] is not inherited because those afflicted do not live beyond infancy.[1] They cannot pass the gene to the next generation.M: BON/CARanat (c/f/k/f, u, t/p, l)/phys/devp/cellnoco/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M5)Ankyrin: Long QT syndrome 4"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:47 UTC +00:00]]

It is characterized by lower than average IQ (typically about 85), problematic impulsive behavior (such as arson, hypersexuality and violence), sleep disorders and mood swings.[1][2] It has only been identified in fourteen males from one family.[1][3]Brunner syndrome is caused by a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) deficiency, which leads to an excess of monoamines in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). In both mice and humans, a mutation was located on the eighth exon of the MAO-A gene, which created a dysfunctional MAO-A gene.[4][5] The regular function of MAO-A, breaking down monoamines, is disrupted, and monoamines build up within the brain. Mice that lacked a functional MAO-A gene displayed higher levels of aggression, in comparison to mice with a functional MAO-A gene.[5]Brunner Syndrome was described in 1993 by H.G. Brunner et al upon the discovery of a particular genetic defect in male members of a large Dutch family.[4] Brunner found that all of the male family members with this defect reacted aggressively when angry, fearful, or frustrated. The defect discovered was later found to be a mutation in the gene that codes for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA gene).[4] Brunner said that an \"MAO-A deficiency is associated with a recognizable behavioural phenotype that included disturbed regulation of impulsive aggression\".[4]A letter published by Hebebrand and Klug (1995)[6] criticized Brunner's findings for not using strict DSM criteria.Brunner's findings have been used to argue that genetics, rather than decision-making processes, can cause criminal activity.[7] Evidence supporting the genetic defense stems from both Brunner's findings and a series of studies on mice.[8] To prove the correlation between MAO-A deficiency and aggression in courts, it is often contended that individuals cannot be held accountable for their genes, and as a result, should not be held responsible for their dispositions and resulting actions.[7][8]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:47 UTC +00:00]]

The disease is slowly progressive and, while there is no cure, there is treatment.There are approximately 200 known cases worldwide.It is named for M. Camurati[2] and G.

Other names include osteopathia hyperostotica scleroticans and multiplex infantalis. In the past this disease was also known as ribbing disease, a name which is no longer used.Human bones are very strong and durable but they are made of live tissues. Bones are constantly being broken down and rebuilt without losing their correct shape and size. When someone has a disease that interferes with this process, which is called bone remodeling, one experiences pain which restricts movement.Clinically, patients with CED complain of chronic bone pain in the legs or arms, muscle weakness (myopathy) and experience a waddling gait. Some other clinical problems associated with the disease are increased fatigue, weakness, muscle spasms, headache, difficulty gaining weight and delay in puberty. Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia, may present with a flat foot or scoliosis.This disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis. This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially just 'lock-up' (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'. This is observed by the broad-based gait with a duck-like waddle to the swing phase, the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised, notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing.The pain is especially severe during a 'flare-up', these can be unpredictable, exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. This is a common occurrence for several CED patients, often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic, severe and disabling pain. Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. 'Flare-ups' may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure.Engelmann's may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged. A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition.Camurati–Engelmann disease is somewhat treatable. Glucocorticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, are used in some cases. This form of medication helps in bone strength, however can have multiple side effects. In several reports, successful treatment with glucocoricosteroids was described, as certain side effects can benefit a person with CED. This drug helps with pain and fatigue as well as some correction of radiographic abnormalities.Alternative treatments such as massage, relaxation techniques (meditation, essential oils, spa baths, music therapy, etc.), gentle stretching, and especially heat therapy have been successfully used to an extent in conjunction with pain medications. A majority of CED patients require some form of analgesics, muscle relaxant, and/or sleep inducing medication to manage the pain, specifically if experiencing frequent or severe 'flare-ups' (e.g. during winter).M: BON/CARanat (c/f/k/f, u, t/p, l)/phys/devp/cellnoco/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (M5)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:47 UTC +00:00]]

Canavan disease is one of the most common degenerative cerebral diseases of infancy. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies.Leukodystrophies are characterized by degeneration of myelin in the phospholipid layer insulating the axon of a neuron. The gene associated with the disorder is located on human chromosome 17.Canavan disease was first described in 1931 by Myrtelle Canavan.[3]The discovery of the gene for Canavan disease, and subsequent events, generated considerable controversy. In 1987 the Greenbergs, a family with two children affected by Canavan disease, donated tissue samples to Dr. Reuben Matalon, a researcher looking for the Canavan gene. He successfully identified the gene in 1993 and developed a test for it that would enable antenatal counselling of couples at risk of having a child with Canavan disease.[4] For a while the Canavan Foundation offered free genetic testing with the test. However, in 1997, Dr. Matalon's employer, Miami Children's Hospital, patented the gene and started claiming royalties on the genetic test, forcing the Canavan Foundation to withdraw their testing. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the Canavan Foundation against Miami Children's Hospital was resolved with a sealed out-of-court settlement.[5] The case is sometimes cited in arguments about the appropriateness of patenting genes.Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it affects people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry more frequently. About 1 in 40 individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry are carriers.Canavan disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of having an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families with two parental carriers.Canavan disease is caused by a defective ASPA gene which is responsible for the production of the enzyme aspartoacylase. Decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents the normal breakdown of N-acetyl aspartate, the accumulation of which interferes with growth of the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers in the brain. The myelin sheath is the fatty covering that surrounds nerve cells and acts as an insulator, which allows for efficient transmission of nerve impulses.Symptoms of Canavan disease, which appear in early infancy and progress rapidly, may include mental retardation, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., floppiness or stiffness), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally enlarged head). Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur.There is no cure for Canavan disease, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, but there is an experimental treatment using lithium citrate. When a person has Canavan Disease, his or her levels of N-acetyl aspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate has proven that, in a rat genetic model of Canavan Disease, the lithium citrate significantly decreased the levels of N-acetyl aspartate. When tested on a human, the subject reversed during a two week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium. The investigation revealed both decreased N-acetyl aspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease.[6]In addition, there are experimental trials of gene therapy. A healthy gene is cloned to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease.[7] This method seems to improve the life of the patient without long-term adverse effects on a 5 years follow-up.[8]Death usually occurs before age 4, but some children with milder forms of the disease survive into their teens and twenties.Research involving triacetin supplementation has shown promise in a rat model.[9] Triacetin, which can be enzymatically cleaved to form acetate, enters the brain more readily than the negatively charged acetate. The defective enzyme in Canavan disease, aspartoacylase, converts N-acetylaspartate into aspartate and acetate. Mutations in the gene for aspartoacylase prevent the breakdown of N-acetylaspartate, and reduce brain acetate availability during brain development. Acetate supplementation using Triacetin is meant to provide the missing acetate so that brain development can continue normally.A team of researchers headed by Paola Leone are currently at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, in Stratford, New Jersey. The brain gene therapy is conducted at Cooper University Hospital. The procedure involves the insertion of six catheters into the brain that deliver a solution containing 600 billion to 900 billion engineered virus particles. The virus, a modified version of AAV, is designed to replace the aspartoacylase enzyme.[7] Children treated with this procedure to date have shown marked improvements, including the growth of myelin with decreased levels of the n-acetyl-aspartate toxin.[10]M: METmt, k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, a/u, n, mk, cgrp/y/i, f/h/s/l/o/e, au, n, m, eponm (A16/C10), i (k, c/g/r/p/y/i, f/h/s/o/e, a/u, n, m)M: CNSanat (n/s/m/p/4/e/b/d/c/a/f/l/g)/phys/devpnoco (m/d/e/h/v/s)/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (N1A/2AB/C/3/4/7A/B/C/D)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:47 UTC +00:00]]

It is a life-threatening illness because each episode has the potential to cause damage to, or the failure of, vital organs due to limited perfusion. It is often misdiagnosed as polycythemia, polycythemia vera or sepsis.The syndrome was first described by B. Clarkson in 1960,[1] after whom it was later informally named. Beyond numerous case reports published since then, two comprehensive reviews of clinical and research experience were published in 2010.[2][3]Most patients report having a runny nose and/or other flu-like symptoms, or else gastro-intestinal disorders (diarrhea or vomiting), or a general weakness or pain in their limbs, but others get no particular or consistent warning signs ahead of their episode. They subsequently develop thirst and lightheadedness and the following measurable conditions:[2][3]An episode of SCLS usually consists of two distinct phases:[2][3]The initial stage is the capillary leak phase, lasting from 1 to 3 days, during which up to 70% of total plasma volume may invade cavities in the trunk and extremities.[2] The most common clinical features are fatigue; lightheadedness up to and including syncope (fainting); limb, abdominal or generalized pain; facial or other edema; dyspnea; and hypotension that results in circulatory shock and potentially in cardiopulmonary collapse and other organ distress or damage.[2][3] Acute renal failure is a risk due to acute tubular necrosis consequent to hypovolemia and rhabdomyolysis.[2][3]The loss of fluid out of the capillaries has similar effects on the circulation as dehydration, slowing both the flow of oxygen delivered to tissues and organs as well as the output of urine. Urgent medical attention in this phase consists of fluid resuscitation efforts, mainly the intravenous administration of saline solution plus hetastarch or albumin and colloids (to increase the remaining blood flow to vital organs like the kidneys), as well as glucocorticoids (steroids like methylprednisolone, to reduce or stop the capillary leak).[2] However, it is important to avoid overly aggressive intravenous fluid administration during this leak phase, because it may cause massive swelling of the extremities and thus serious collateral damage because of induced compartment syndromes.[3]The second stage features the reabsorption of the initially extravasated fluid and it usually lasts just as long as the leak phase. Intravascular fluid overload leads to polyuria and can cause flash pulmonary edema with possibly fatal consequences.[2][3] The severity of the problem depends on to the quantity of fluid supplied in the initial phase, the damage that may have been sustained by the kidneys, and the promptness with which diuretics are administered to help the patient discharge the accumulated fluids quickly.[2]The prevention of episodes of SCLS has involved two approaches. The first has long been identified with the Mayo Clinic and it recommends treatment with beta agonists such as theophylline, terbutaline and montelukast sodium.[4] The second, more recent approach pioneered in France involves monthly intravenous infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and the growing case-report evidence is encouraging.[5][6][7][8]A recent review of clinical experience with 28 European SCLS patients suggests that either prophylactic treatment may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and may improve survival.[9]In the Mayo Clinic’s experience, the median survival of 25 patients that were followed over 30 years (counting only SCLS-related deaths) was approximately 15 years, and their 5-year survival rate was 76%.[2][3] In European experience, the 5-year post-diagnosis survival rate was 85% in 23 patients who had received prophylactic treatment and 20% in 5 patients who had not.[9] However, better identification and management of this condition appears to be resulting in lower mortality and improving survival and quality-of-life results as of late.M: VASanat (a:h/u/t/a/l,v:h/u/t/a/l)/phys/devp/cell/protnoco/syva/cong/lyvd/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (C2s+n/3/4/5/7/8/9)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:47 UTC +00:00]]

Cellular, or tissue carnosinase.[11] This form of the enzyme is found in every bodily tissue. It is a dimer, and hydrolyzes both carnosine and anserine, preferring dipeptides that have a histidine monomer in the c-terminus position.[10][11] Tissue carnosinase is often considered a \"non-specific dipeptidase\",[12][14] based in part on its ability to hydrolyze a range of dipeptide substrates, including those belonging to prolinase.[15]2. Serum carnosinase.[13] This is the carnosinase found in the blood plasma. Deficiency of this form of carnosinase, along with carnosinuria (\"carnosine in the urine\"), is the usual metabolic indicator of systemic carnosinase deficiency.[3][8][16] Serum carnosinase is a glycoprotein, and splits free carnosine and anserine in the blood.[10] This form of the dipeptidase is not found in human blood until late infancy, slowly rising to adult levels by age 15.[13] Unlike tissue carnosinase, serum carnosinase also hydrolyzes the GABA metabolite homocarnosine.[10]Homocarnosinosis, a neurological disorder resulting in an excess of homocarnosine in the brain, though unaffected by tissue carnosinase, is caused by a deficiency of serum carnosinase in its ability to hydrolyze homocarnosine.[17]A deficiency of tissue and serum carnosinase, with serum being an indicator, is the underlying metabolic cause of carnosinemia.[7][9]A variety of neurological symptoms have been associated with carnosinemia. They include: hypotonia, developmental delay, mental retardation, degeneration of axons, sensory neuropathy, tremors, demyelinization, gray matter anomalies, myoclonic seizures, and loss of purkinje fibers.[3][4][8][9]The gene for carnosinase is located on chromosome 18,[3] an autosome. The carnosine dipeptidase-1 gene (CNDP1) controls tissue and serum carnosinase.[18] Mutations in CNDP1 are responsible for carnosinase deficiency, resulting in carnosinemia.[3]Carnosinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder,[3] which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - are required to inherit the disorder.

There are two types of Caroli disease, the most common being the simple, or isolated case where the bile ducts are widened by ectasia. The second, more complex, cause is commonly known as Caroli Syndrome. This complex form is also linked with portal hypertension and congenital hepatic fibrosis. [1] The differences between the causes of the two cases have not yet been discovered. Caroli disease is also associated with liver failure and polycystic kidney disease. The disease affects about 1 in 1,000,000 people, with more reported cases of Caroli syndrome than of Caroli disease. [2]Caroli disease also is known as communicating cavernous ectasia, or congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree. Caroli disease is distinct from other diseases that cause ductal dilatation caused by obstruction, in that it is not one of the many choledochal cyst derivatives. [1]Jacques Caroli, a gastroenterologist, first described a rare congenital condition in 1958 in Paris, France. [3][4] He described it as \"nonobstructive saccular or fusiform multi-focal segmental dilatation of the intra-hepatic bile ducts\"; basically, he observed cavernous ectasia in the biliary tree causing a chronic, often life-threatening hepatobiliary disease. [5] Caroli, born in France in 1902, learned and practiced medicine in Angers. After World War II he was chief of service for 30 years at Saint-Antoine in Paris. Before dying in 1979, he was honored with the rank of commander in the Legion of Honour in 1976.[4]The first symptoms typically include fever, intermittent abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Occasionally jaundice occurs. [6] Caroli disease usually occurs in the presence of other diseases, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, cholangitis, gallstones, bilary abscess, septicemia, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and cholangiocarcinoma (7% affected).[1] People with Caroli disease are 100 times more at risk for cholangiocarcinoma than the general population.[6] After recognizing symptoms of related diseases, Caroli disease can be diagnosed.Modern imaging techniques allow the diagnosis to be made more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree.[7] Commonly the disease is limited to the left lobe of the liver. Images taken by CT-scan, X-ray, or MRI will show enlarged intrahepatic (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an ultrasound, tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT-Scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver.[6] A high contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear sonogram, therefore, a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as central dots or a linear streak.[8] Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound.[8] However, cholangiography is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.Caroli disease is typically found in Asia and diagnosed in persons under the age of 22.[1] Cases have also been found in both infants and adults. As medical imaging technology improves, diagnostic age decreases. Morbidity is common and is caused by complications of cholangitis, sepsis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma.[9] These morbid conditions often prompt the diagnosis. Portal hypertension may be present, resulting in other conditions including splenomegaly, hematemesis and melena.[10] These problems can severely affect the patient's quality of life. In a ten-year period between 1995 and 2005, only ten patients were surgically treated for Caroli disease, with an average patient age of 45.8 years.[9]After reviewing 46 cases of Caroli disease before 1990, it was found that 21.7% of the cases were the result of an intraheptic cyst or non-obstructive biliary tree dilation, 34.7% were linked with congenital hepatic fibrosis, 13% were isolated choledochal cystic dilation, and the remaining 24.6% had a combination of all three.[11]Mortality is indirect and caused by complications. After cholangitis occurs, patients typically die within approximately 5–10 years.[2]The cause appears to be genetic; the simple form is an autosomal dominant trait while the complex form is an autosomal recessive trait.[1] Females are more prone to Caroli disease than males.[3] Family history may include kidney and liver disease due to the link between Caroli Disease and ARPKD.[10]PKHD1, the gene linked to ARPKD, has been found mutated in patients with Caroli syndrome. PKHD1 is expressed primarily in the kidneys with lower levels in the liver, pancreas, and lungs, a pattern consistent with phenotype of the disease, which primarily affects the liver and kidneys.[1][10] The genetic basis for the difference between Caroli disease and Caroli syndrome has not been defined.The treatment depends on clinical features and the location of the biliary abnormality. When the disease is localized to one hepatic lobe, hepatectomy relieves symptoms and appears to remove the risk of malignancy.[12] There is good evidence that malignancy complicates Caroli disease in approximately 7% of cases.[12]Antibiotics are used to treat the inflammation of the bile duct, and ursodeoxycholic acid for hepatolithiasis.[7]Ursodiol is given to treat cholelithiasis. In diffuse cases of Caroli disease, treatment options include conservative or endoscopic therapy, internal biliary bypass procedures and liver transplantation in carefully selected cases.[12] Surgical resection has been used successfully in patients with monolobar disease.[7] An orthotopic liver transplant is another option, used only when antibiotics have no effect, in combination with recurring cholangitis.

There were originally five types of ACPS, but this number has been decreased because they have been found to be closely related to one another or to other disorders (Paul A. Johnson, 2002). The most common physical manifestation of Carpenter Syndrome is early fusing of the fibrous cranial sutures which results in an abnormally pointed head. The fusion of the skull bones is evident from birth (National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc., 2008). Babies’ mobile cranial bones form a cone shape as the pass through the birth canal and soon thereafter return to a normal shape; however, a baby affected by carpenter syndrome maintains a cone shaped head.A baby affected by Carpenter Syndrome will also display malformations of the face. An individual affected by the syndrome may have broad cheeks, a flat nasal bridge, and a wide upturned nose with abnormally large nasal openings. Their ears will most commonly be low, unevenly set, and malformed in structure. In addition to these facial abnormalities, individuals also have an underdeveloped maxilla and/ or mandible with a highly arched and narrow palate which makes speech a very difficult skill to master. Teeth are usually very late to come in and will be undersized and spaced far apart (Carpenter Syndrome-description).Other physical abnormalities often associated with Carpenter Syndrome include extra digits. Extra toes are more commonly seen than fingers. Often both the toes and fingers are webbed, a process that occurs before the sixth week gestational period. Often their digits will be abnormally short, and the fingers are commonly missing an interphalangeal joint. Roughly half of the babies born with Carpenter Syndrome have some type of heart defect, and seventy five percent of individuals with this disease will experience some degree of development delay due to mild mental retardation (Carpenter Syndrome-description).The primary diagnostic factor is a malformation of the skull. The two most common types of craniosynostosis are sagittal and bicoronal. Sagittal craniosynostosis manifests itself by causing a long narrow skull. It is quantitatively determined by measuring the anterior to posterior (front to back) diameter of the skull. An increased A-P diameter indicates a malformed fusion of the sagittal suture. Individuals affected with sagittal craniosynostosis have narrow, prominent foreheads and the back of the head is much larger than normal. The “soft spot” is very small or missing altogether with this particular type of craniosynostosis.The second common type of skull malformation is bicoronal craniosynostosis is characterized by a wide, short skull. In this particular type of craniosynostosis the A-P diameter is smaller than in normal individuals. These individuals have malformed eye sockets and foreheads. The eye sockets are much smaller than normal and often cause visual impairment. Complications may include damage to the optic nerve, resulting in a decrease in visual clarity, bulging eye balls as a result of shallow eye orbits which usually causes some sort of damage to the cornea (the outer layer of the eye). Bicoronal craniosynostosis may also result in widely spaced eyes and narrowing of the sinuses and tear ducts that may result in inflammation of the mucous membranes of the exposed portion of the eye.In addition to the previously named complications of bicoronal craniosynostosis, many babies will also be affected by hydrocephalus, more commonly known as water on the brain. Hydrocephalus results in increased pressure on the brain which can cause permanent brain damage if not treated promptly. An abnormally highly arched palate is also seen in affected individuals causing dental problems and the thrusting forward of the lower jaw. Individuals affected by Carpenter syndrome often experience cutaneous syndactyly (fusion of the digits) or polydactyly (presence of extra digits) of the toes more often than fingers. Individuals also have short fingers.Approximately one third of individuals born with Carpenter Syndrome have a type of heart defect. Commonly seen heart defects may include: narrowing of the pulmonary artery, transposition of the major blood vessels, or the presence of an abnormally large vena cava, which delivers blood back to the heart from the head, neck, and upper limbs. The testes of males affected by Carpenter Syndrome may also fail to descend (Paul A. Johnson, 2002).The diagnosis of Carpenter Syndrome is made based on the presence of the bicoronal and sagittal skull malformations, which results in a pointed, cone-shaped or short, broad head. The diagnosis is also made based on the presence of extra or fused digits. X rays and/ or CT scans of the skull may be performed in order to accurately diagnose the individual; however, other genetic disorders, which have available genetic tests, are also characterized by skull malformations. A positive result on these tests can rule out a Carpenter Syndrome diagnosis.There are approximately three hundred known cases of Carpenter Syndrome in the United States. Only 1 in 1 million live births will result in an infant affected by Carpenter Syndrome (RN, 2007).Carpenter Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease which means both parents must have the faulty genes in order to pass the disease onto their children. Even if both parents possess the faulty gene there is still only a twenty five percent chance that they will produce a child affected by the syndrome. Their children who do not have the disease will still be carriers and possess the ability to pass the disease onto their offspring if their spouse is also a carrier of the particular gene.[6]Operations to correct the malformations of the skull should be performed within the first year of infancy in patients affected by Carpenter Syndrome. Performing surgery at a young age increases the likelihood of obtaining a greatly improved appearance of the head because modifying bone is much easier to do when the skull is still constantly growing and changing.[6]In surgery the doctor breaks the fused sutures to allow for brain growth. Doctors remove the cranial plates of the skull, reshape them and replace them back onto the skull in an attempt to reshape the head to appear more normal. Although the sutures are broken during surgery they will quickly refuse, and in some cases holes form in the plates allowing cerebral spinal fluid to escape into cyst like structures on the external surface of the head.[7]If an individual with Carpenter Syndrome has a serious heart defect they will require surgery to correct the malformation of the heart. Other elective surgeries may also be performed. Some parents opt to have their child’s webbed fingers or toes separated which improves their appearance but not necessarily the functionality of the digits. In order to address the occupational challenges of the disease, many children with Carpenter Syndrome go through speech and occupational therapy in order to achieve more independence in everyday tasks and activities (RN, 2007).In order to address the vision problems that are associated with bicoronal craniosynostosis, the individual must seek consultation from an ophthalmologist. If the palate is severely affected dental consultation may be necessary to correct the malformation. Obesity is often associated with Carpenter Syndrome, so a lifelong diet plan is often utilized to maintain a healthy weight. In addition surgery must be performed if the testes fail to descend (Paul A. Johnson, 2002). If the procedure is not performed the individual will become infertile."], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

Typically, it occurs in women aged 30–40 years, but has been diagnosed in young girls as early as 10 years of age and post menopausal women (exclusively in women of menstrual age) most with a history of pelvic endometriosis.Endometrial tissue attaches within the thoracic cavity, forming chocolate-like cysts. Generally the parietal pleura is involved, but the lung itself, the visceral layer, the diaphragm, and more rarely the tracheobronchial tree may also be afflicted.[2] How this endometrial tissue reaches the thorax remains enigmatic. Defects in the diaphragm, which are found often in affected individuals, could provide an entry path,[3] as could microembolization through pelvic veins.[4]The cysts can release blood; the endometrial cyst \"menstruates\" in the lung. Air can move in by an unknown mechanism. The blood and air cause the lung to collapse (i.e. catamenial hemopneumothorax).[5]Diagnosis can be hinted by high recurrence rates of lung collapse in a woman of reproductive age with endometriosis. CA-125 is elevated. Video-assisted thoracoscopy is used for confirmation.Pneumothorax can be a medical emergency, as it can become associated with severe pain and decreased lung function. A chest tube should be inserted after clinical assessment. This releases the air and menstrual blood, and the lung can re-expand.Surgery, hormonal treatments and combined approaches have all been proposed, with variable results in terms of short and long term outcome.[6] Surgical removal of the endometrial tissue should be endeavoured during menstruation for optimal visualisation of the cyst.[7]Pleurodesis may also be helpful. Menstruation and accompanying lung collapse can be suppressed with hormone therapy,[8] like with Lupron Depot, danazol or extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pills.Some sources claim this entity represents 3-6% of pneumothorax in women.[8] In regard of the low incidence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (i.e. not due to surgical trauma etc.) in women (about 1/100'000/year),[8] this is a very rare condition. Hence, many basic textbooks don't mention it, and many doctors have never heard of it. Therefore, catamenial pneumothorax is probably under-recognised.[3]M: RESanat (n, x, l, c)/phys/devpnoco (c, p)/cong/tumr, sysi/epon, injrproc, drug (R1/2/3/5/6/7)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

Minor cases may be more or less without symptom, whereas severe cases may come with major birth defects, neurological impairment (i.e. Flaccid paralysis of lower extremities) and incontinence.There are four levels (or \"types\") of malformation. The least severe indicates partial deformation (unilateral) of the sacrum. The second level indicates a bilateral (uniform) deformation. The most severe types involve a total absence of the sacrum.Depending on the type of sacral agenesis, bowel or urinary bladder deficiencies may be present. A permanent colostomy may be necessary in the case of imperforate anus. Incontinence may also require some type of continence control system (e.g. self-catheterization) be utilized. Occasionally if deformities of the knees, legs or feet would prove unresponsive to corrective action, amputation at the knee may be proposed.Before more comprehensive medical treatment was available, full amputation of the legs at the hip was often performed. More recently, the 'amputation' (actually a disarticulation because no cutting of the bone is involved) is done at the knee for those who have bent knee positions and webbing between thigh and calf to enable more ease of mobility and better seating. Some children with knee disarticulation use prosthetic legs to walk. Prosthetics for children without substantial hip and trunk control is usually abandoned in favor of faster and easier wheelchair mobility as the child's weight and age increases. Children may 'walk' on their hands and generally are able to climb and move about to accomplish whatever they need and want to accomplish. Children more mildly affected may have normal gait and no need for assistive devices for walking. Others may walk with bracing or crutches.There is typically no cognitive impairment associated with this disability. Adults with this disability live independently, attend college, and have careers in various fields. In 2012, Spencer West, a man with sacral agenesis and both legs amputated, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro using only his hands.[2]The condition arises from some factor or set of factors present during approximately the 3rd week to 7th week of fetal development. Formation of the sacrum/lower back and corresponding nervous system is usually nearing completion by the 4th week of development. Due to abnormal gastrulation, the mesoderm migration is disturbed. This disturbance results in symptoms varying from minor lesions of the lower vertebrae to more severe symptoms such as complete fusion of the lower limbs. While the exact etiology is unknown, it has been speculated that the condition may be associated with certain dietary deficiencies including a lack or insufficient amounts of folic acid.Sacral agenesis syndrome (agenesis of the lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx, and hypoplasia of the lower extremities) is a well-established congenital anomaly associated with maternal diabetes mellitus (not gestational diabetes). However, other etiologic factors are presumably involved, as demonstrated by the rare incidence of caudal regression syndrome (1:60,000) compared to diabetes. Certainly not all children born with Caudal Regression Syndrome have diabetic mothers.The dominant inherited sacral agenesis (also referred to as Currarino syndrome) is very often correlated with a mutation in the Hb9 (also called HlxB9) gene (shown by Sally Ann Lynch, 1995, Nature Genetics).It may be the cause of sirenomelia (\"Mermaid Syndrome\").Synonyms for CRS:"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

This form of hyponatraemia is due to excessive renal sodium excretion resulting from a centrally mediated process.The condition was initially described in 1950.[1]Primary symptoms include polyuria (at least 2.5 liters in the course of 24 hours, for adults) due to inadequate sodium retention in the body, polydipsia (excessive thirst) due to polyuria, extreme salt cravings (e.g. desire to drink pickle juice), dysautonomia, and dehydration. Patients often \"self-medicate\" by naturally gravitating toward a high-sodium diet and by dramatically increasing their water intake. Advanced symptoms include muscle cramps, lightheadedness, dizziness or vertigo, feelings of anxiety or panic (not mentally induced), tachycardia (rapid heart rate) or bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension and orthostatic hypotension sometimes resulting in syncope.[2] Other symptoms frequently associated with dysautonomia include: headaches, pallor, malaise, facial flushing, constipation or diarrhea, nausea, acid reflux, visual disturbances, numbness, nerve pain, trouble breathing, chest pains, loss of consciousness and seizures.[2]CSWS is usually caused by brain injury/trauma or cerebral lesion, tumor, or hematoma. CSWS is a diagnosis of exclusion and may be difficult to distinguish from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which develops under similar circumstances and also presents with hyponatremia. The main clinical difference is that of total fluid status of the patient: CSWS leads to a relative or overt hypovolemia whereas SIADH is consistent with a normal to hypervolemic range. Random urine sodium concentrations tend to be lower than 100 mEq/L in CSWS and greater in SIADH . If blood-sodium levels increase when fluids are restricted, SIADH is more likely.[3]While CSWS usually appears within the first week after brain injury and spontaneously resolves in 2–4 weeks, it can sometimes last for months or years. While fluid restriction is used to treat SIADH, CSWS requires aggressive hydration and correction of the low sodium levels using sodium chloride tablets.

Additional features include poor prenatal growth, preterm birth, anemia, osteopenia and bone fractures,[3][4][5] and gastrointestinal bleeding.[6] It is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the conserved telomere maintenance component 1 (CTC1) gene,[7][8] but its exact pathophysiology is still not well understood.Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts is alternatively known as the Coats plus syndrome,[3] a reference to its most typical ocular phenotype.A child who has inherited this disorder will grow slower than normal in the uterus before birth and typically will be born before term.[1][2][3] The pregnancy can be complicated by gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.The majority of affected children present with symptoms and signs relating to the eyes such as leukokoria, redness, irritation and impaired vision, which result from retinal detachment and glaucoma.[1][2][3] A minority present with seizures or spasticity. The time of onset of symptoms varies from infancy to adolescence. Because a child born before term will need to undergo screening for retinopathy of prematurity, some will have abnormalities in their retinal blood vessels detected when they have no symptoms yet.Neurologic symptoms and signs vary depending on the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial epilepsy, asymmetric spasticity, ataxia and cognitive impairment.[1][2][3] The latter affects visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills first. The intracranial pressure can be elevated if cysts develop in the brain. Migraine-like headaches can occur.Smaller blood vessels of the retina are abnormally developed and appear tortuous and dilated to a variable extent, typically in one sector and mainly in the peripheral and temporal portions of the retina.[1][2][3][9] This is known as telangiectasia. The vessel walls are week and leak blood plasma and lipid within and underneath the retina. This leakage can lead to exudative retinal detachment, also known as exudative retinopathy in this context. The detachment typically has a yellowish tint because the fluid under the retina contains lipid. These findings mimic Coats disease.[9] Characteristically, the abnormal vessels are localized and the retinal blood vessels peripheral to the abnormal ones seemingly have failed to develop and are thus not seen.In some eyes, retinal vessels form small nodules on the surface of the retina, known as angiomas.[1] These can bleed and be attached to the vitreous humour. The attachment can cause traction retinal detachment.Recurrent intestinal bleeding is fairly common.[1][2][6] It originates from telangiectatic small blood vessels in the intestinal mucosa. Additional findings in some individuals are portal hypertension and liver failure.[1][2]Many affected children develop anemia, which may be macrocytic in type.[1][2][4] Some also develop thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow examinations may show megaloblasts and increased erythropoiesis or bone marrow suppression.[1][2][4]The long bones show osteopenia and pathologic fractures can occur.[1][2][4][5]Some children have sparse and greying hair, café au lait spots and nail dystrophy.[1][2][9]Most patients continue to grow poorly after birth.[1][3]Typical childhood-onset cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the conserved telomere maintenance component 1 (CTC1) gene[10] located in chromosome 17p.31.[7][8] A late-onset phenotype without abnormal eye findings from a CTC1 mutation has been reported.[8]CTC1[10] is a component of the CST complex,[11] which is additionally composed of oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 1 (coded by OBFC1,[12] also known as STN1) and telomerase capping complex subunit homolog 1 (coded by TEN1).[13] CST complex is evolutionarily conserved.[11] It binds to single-stranded DNA and associates with a fraction of telomeres, potentially protecting them.Numeous bnormal small dilated telangiectatic vessels with thickened, sclerotic and calcified walls and angiomas have been found in those brain areas which also show calcifications.[1][2]By analogy to Coats disease, the exudative retinopathy is thought to result from breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier at the level of the vascular endothelial cell, resulting in leakage of blood plasma and lipid.[14]Macrophages then migrate into the retina and subretinal space and digest the lipid. The accumulation of the proteinaceous exudate and macrophages thickens the retina, leading to exudative retinal detachment.The retinal changes are easily identified by ophthalmoscopy, which is performed under general anesthesia if the child is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with fluorescein angiography. In advanced disease, glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring intraocular pressure and cataract by using slit lamp biomicroscopy.The most consistent finding are widespread calcifications, which involve the white matter of the cerebrum mostly adjacent to the junction with the grey matter, the thalami, the basal ganglia and the brainstem.[1][2] The white matter of the cerebellum and the dentate nuclei are less often involved. However, the brain may appear normal in the neonatal period. The calcifications are visible both with computed tomography and with magnetic resonance imaging.Magnetic resonance imaging shows additionally diffuse or patchy white matter changes, especially in the periventricular region, the thalami and the internal capsule. Cerebellar and brainstem lesions are less common. Imaging also uncovers parenchymal cysts situated mainly in the thalamic region and more rarely in the brainstem, the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe.The long bones may be osteopenic and various skeletal changes are found in several patients, such as metaphyseal sclerosis and mild flaring, which is most pronounced in the femur and tibia.[3][4][5]The cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests are typically normal, except for anemia and thrombocytopenia in some children.[1][2][4]Because of the rarity of the syndrome, it is not routinely screened before birth. Prenatal diagnosis is possible in families in which a prior child has been diagnosed, because the responsible gene CTC1is known.[7][8]Seizures are managed with anticonvulsive medications.Laser coagulation or cryoablation (freezing) of the retina can be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. Retinal detachment is repaired with a scleral buckle or with vitrectomy. Removal or enucleation of the eye is a last resort option if the eye already has become blind and painful.Repeated blood transfusions may be needed to control anemia, and thrombocytopenia can be managed with splenectomy.[1]The neurological symptoms are progressive and can lead to severe spasticity, bulbar symptoms and dysarthria within one to two decades.[1][3] The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is pneumonia, fulminant intestinal bleeding or multiple organ dysfunction.[1]If not treated, the retinal detachment can lead to ischemia and growth of new blood vessels over the iris and anterior chamber angle. This in turn can cause secondary glaucoma, cataract and, ultimately, blindness of the eye.[1][2]This syndrome is usually sporadic although families with two or more affected siblings of both sexes are known.[1][3]A child who was eventually diagnosed with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts was first described in the literature in 1987.[9][15] The disorder was suspected of being allelic with either the Revesz syndrome[2] or leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts.[1][2] However, Revesz syndrome, a severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita, was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the TINF2 gene,[16] which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, a major component of the telomere protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts phenotype have not had mutations in the CTC1 gene.[7][8]Before the causative mutation was identified, mutations were sought from the Wnt signalling pathway because its components were known to be responsible for Norrie disease and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, which share features of the eye phenotype but not the brain or systemic abnormalities.[1][2]Coats' disease is named after George Coats.[17][18]"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

Affected children are susceptible to infection by Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common infection cause. Neuropathy often begins in the teenage years and becomes the most prominent problem. Infections in CHS patients tend to be very serious and even life-threatening; few patients with this condition live to adulthood.Most children with Chédiak–Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage known as the accelerated phase, also known as the lymphoma-like-syndrome. This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by a viral infection, usually the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).[citation needed] In the accelerated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life-threatening in childhood.Mutations in the CHS1 gene (also called LYST) have been found to be connected with Chédiak–Higashi Syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. Researchers believe that this protein plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of materials into structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes act as recycling centers within cells. They use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components. Although the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein is involved in the normal function of lysosomes, its exact role is unknown.[6]CHS is a disease causing impaired bacteriolysis[7] due to failure of phagolysosome formation. As a result of disordered intracellular trafficking there is impaired lysosome degranulation with phagosomes, so phagocytosed bacteria are not destroyed by the lysosome's enzymes.In addition, secretion of lytic secretory granules by cytotoxic T cells is affected.The disease is characterised by large lysosome vesicles in phagocytes (neutrophils), which thus have poor bactericidal function, leading to susceptibility to infections, abnormalities in nuclear structure of leukocytes, anemia, and hepatomegaly.The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow smears that show \"giant inclusion bodies\" in the cells that develop into white blood cells (leukocyte precursor cells). CHS can be diagnosed prenatally by examining a sample of hair from a fetal scalp biopsy or testing leukocytes from a fetal blood sample.[8]Under light microscopy the hairs present evenly distributed, regular melanin granules, larger than those found in normal hairs. Under polarized light microscopy these hairs exhibit a bright and polychromatic refringence pattern.[9]There are several manifestations of Chédiak–Higashi syndrome as mentioned above; however, neutropenia seems to be the most common. The syndrome is associated with oculocutaneous albinism. Persons are prone for infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Streptococci.It is associated with periodontal disease of the deciduous dentition. Associated features include abnormalities in melanocytes (albinism), nerve defects, bleeding disorders.There is no specific treatment for Chédiak–Higashi syndrome. Bone marrow transplants appear to have been successful in several patients. Infections are treated with antibiotics and abscesses are surgically drained when appropriate. Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir have been tried during the terminal phase of the disease. Cyclophosphamide and prednisone have been tried. Vitamin C therapy has improved immune function and clotting in some patients.[10]It is named for the Cuban physician and serologist Alejandro Moisés Chédiak (1903–1993) and the Japanese pediatrician Otokata Higashi (1883–1981).[11] It is often spelled without the accent as Chediak–Higashi syndrome.chemotaxis/degranulation: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD1, LAD2) ·  Chédiak–Higashi syndromeM: MYLcell/phys (coag, heme, immu, gran), csfsrbmg/mogr/tumr/hist, sysi/epon, btstdrug (B1/2/3+5+6), btst, trnsvitiligo: Quadrichrome vitiligo ·  Vitiligo ponctué ·  syndromic (Alezzandrini syndrome ·  Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome)albinism: Oculocutaneous albinism ·  Ocular albinismmelanosome transfer: Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome ·  Chédiak–Higashi syndrome ·  Griscelli syndrome (Elejalde syndrome ·  Griscelli syndrome type 2 ·  Griscelli syndrome type 3)Lentigo/Lentiginosis: Lentigo simplex ·  Liver spot ·  Centrofacial lentiginosis ·  Generalized lentiginosis ·  Inherited patterned lentiginosis in black persons ·  Ink spot lentigo ·  Lentigo maligna ·  Mucosal lentigines ·  Partial unilateral lentiginosis ·  PUVA lentiginesM: INT, SF, LCTanat/phys/devpnoco (i/b/d/q/u/r/p/m/k/v/f)/cong/tumr (n/e/d), sysi/eponproc, drug (D2/3/4/5/8/11)Lysosome/Melanosome: HPS1-HPS7 (Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome) ·  LYST (Chédiak–Higashi syndrome) ·COPII: SEC23A (Cranio–lenticulo–sutural dysplasia)COG7 (CDOG IIE)ARL6 (BBS3)RAB27A (Griscelli syndrome 2)Myosin: MYO5A (Griscelli syndrome 1)Microtubule: SPG4 (Hereditary spastic paraplegia 4)Kinesin: KIF5A (Hereditary spastic paraplegia 10)Synaptic vesicle: SNAP29 (CEDNIK syndrome) ·  STX11 (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 4)Caveolae: CAV1 (Congenital generalized lipodystrophy 3) ·  CAV3 (Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Long QT syndrome 9)Vacuolar protein sorting: VPS33B (ARC syndrome) ·  VPS13B (Cohen syndrome)"], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:48 UTC +00:00]]

CESD can present in childhood but often goes unrecognized until adulthood when the underlying pathology is advanced. Many of the signs and symptoms are common to patients with other liver conditions.CESD is an autosomal recessive genetic condition and is characterized by hepatomegaly, persistently abnormal LFTs and type II hyperlipidemia. Splenomegaly and evidence of mild hypersplenism may affect some patients. Untreated, CESD may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and death.\nDisease Risk In Families:\n• 25 per million incidence\n• Autosomal recessive disorder, LAL deficiency is carried on chromosome 10\n• Parents with an affected son or daughter have a 1 in 4 chance of having another affected childPatients with cholesteryl ester storage disease typically have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels (type II hyperlipidemia) and may present at an early age with the following liver abnormalities:\n• Unexplained hepatomegaly\n• Elevated transaminases\n• Unexplained fatty liver\n• Progressive and/or unexplained chronic liver diseaseType II hyperlipidemia in association with unexplained fatty liver or elevated transaminases in more than one sibling in a family would warrant consideration of a diagnosis of CESD.Patients with CESD are typically investigated for infectious, metabolic and autoimmune liver disease. Imaging may suggest hepatic steatosis and liver biopsies when performed show accumulation of fat in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Periportal fibrosis and cirrhosis is not uncommon. Descriptive terms including sea blue Histiocytosis may be applied to the liver abnormalities.Useful diagnostic clues• Low normal High-density lipoprotein (HDL)(<10th percentile or <35 mg/dL for men and women), especially very low HDL (<5–10 mg/dL)\n• Excessive hepatomegaly and/or transaminase increase for a given BMI\n• Unusual coexisting lymphadenopathy or enlarged lymph nodes\n• Onset of liver abnormalities in childhood\n• Clinical suspicion of visceral Niemann Pick not confirmed by enzyme analysis\n• An enlarged spleen that is disproportionate in size to the degree of liver involvement/diseaseOther manifestations\n• Short stature\n• Premature cardiac disease\n• Premature stroke\n• MalabsorptionChallenges in diagnosis\nCholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is rare and can be difficult to diagnose. Recent studies using genetic analysis suggest that heterozygote carriers of a common disease causing mutation for CESD are more common than previously thought with a carrier frequency for this mutation of about 1 in 200 or 5000 per million. Based on these carrier frequencies and the mutation spectrum of published CESD cases this translates to an estimate of approximately 25 cases of CESD per million births.Delayed diagnosis may be the result of disease under-recognition and/or symptoms being mistaken for those of other disorders, such as:• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\n• Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\n• Alcoholic liver disease\n• Cryptogenic cirrhosisClinical diagnosis is based upon presentation of signs, symptoms and laboratory abnormalities (lipids, liver transaminases) and may be confirmed by enzyme assay (blood test) detecting low or absent levels of lysosomal acid lipase or in relatives of affected patients by mutation linkage analysis (blood test).There is no disease modifying treatment for cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). Combining drugs that reduce blood cholesterol with a low cholesterol diet has been effective at reducing some of the symptoms associated with this genetic disorder.Synageva BioPharma Corp. of Lexington, Massachusetts, is recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial that evaluates an enzyme replacement therapy of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency.

It belongs to a group of four diseases characterized under the name Neuroacanthocytosis.[2] When a patient's blood is viewed under a microscope, some of the red blood cells appear thorny. These thorny cells are called acanthocytes.Other effects of the disease may include epilepsy, behaviour changes, muscle degeneration, and neuronal degradation similar to Huntington's Disease. The average age of onset of symptoms is 35 years. The disease is incurable and inevitably leads to premature death.Some more information about Chorea-acanthocytosis is that it is a very complex autosomal recessive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. It often shows itself as a mixed movement disorder, in which chorea, tics, dystonia and even parkinsonism may appear as a symptom. [3]This disease is also characterized by the presence of a few different movement disorders including chorea, dystonia etc. [4]Chorea-acanthocytosis is considered an autosomal recessive disorder, although a few cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been noted.[1]There are multiple symptoms that can help this disease to be diagnosed, this disease is marked by the presence of acanthocytes in blood (these acanthocytes can sometimes be absent or even make a late appearance in the course of the disease.)[5] and neurodegeneration causing a choreiform movement disorder.[6]Another one of them would be that this disease should be considered in patients who have elevated levels of acanthocytes in a peripheral blood film.\nThe serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease.[3]\nPeople afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration.[6] There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia, one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms. [4]Protein function tests that demonstrate a reduce in chorein levels and also genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis given to a patient. For a disease like this it is often necessary to sample the blood of the patient on multiple occasions with a specific request given to the haematologist to examine the film for acanthrocytes.[3] Another point is that the diagnosis of the disease can be confirmed by the absence of chorein in the western blot of the erythrocyte membranes.[6]The treatment to battle the disease chorea-acanthocytosis is completely symptomatic. For example, Botulinum toxin injections can help to control orolingual dystonia.[3]Deep Brain Stimulation is a treatment that has varied effects on the people suffering from the symptoms of this disease, for some it has helped in a large way and for other people it did not help whatsoever, it is more effective on specific symptoms of the disease.[4] Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis should undergo a cardiac evaluation every 5 years to look for cardiomyopathy."], ["updated_at", Sun, 01 Dec 2013 03:22:49 UTC +00:00]]

The 5q- syndrome is found predominantly in females of advanced age.An association with RPS14 has been identified.[2]Deletion of the miR-145 and miR-146 loci has been associated with elevated platelet count and megakaryocytic dysplasia associated with the 5q- syndrome.[3]This syndrome affects bone marrow cells causing treatment-resistant anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes that may lead to acute myelogenous leukemia.
